The Cosmonaut ("El Cosmonauta") is a Spanish science-fiction film, directed by Nicolás Alcalá and produced by Carola Rodríguez and Bruno Teixidor. It premiered in May 2013. The first feature-length project of "Riot Cinema Collective" is notable for its use of crowdfunding and Creative Commons license in its production. In 1967, two young friends, Stas and Andrei, arrive to the newly built Star City (near Moscow) where the first cosmonauts trained to go into space, and where a race against the clock to beat the Americans into space takes place. Stas and Andrei will witness first-hand the political plots, the fights for power and the successes and failures of the Soviet Union in some of the greatest achievements of the 20th century. They will meet Yulia, a communications technician, with whom they will strike up a strong friendship, always close to love but never consummated. The main influences behind "The Cosmonaut"'s conception and filmmaking approach are the works of some of the world's most renowned filmmakers. The project's dossier mentions specifically the names of Wong Kar-wai (and his main cinematographer, Christopher Doyle), Andrei Tarkovsky, José Luis Guerín, and Robert Bresson, among others. There are many links especially to Andrei Tarkovsky's body of work either thematically (the main themes of the films of memory, lost love, and reality), or plot-related (the film's two main characters, Andrei and Stas Arsenievich, share Andrei Tarkovsky's name and patronymic, respectively). These ties are more evident through a look in the collaborators’ list: among others, the names of Eduard Artemyev, and Marina Tarkovskaya (Tarkovky's sister). The fictional Program K, whose hummingbird icon is one of the main images used in the project's promotion, and which also gives its name to the virtual community of producers of the film, is based on the real Soviet projects that attempted to place a Soviet cosmonaut on the Moon. The idea behind "The Cosmonaut" emerged from two main sources: a) the conversations between Nicolás Alcalá and Bruno Teixidor (the main creative minds behind the project's visual looks) about conspiracies, the Lost Cosmonauts theories and the Soviet space program; and b) the poetry book "Poetics for Cosmonauts", written by Henry Pierrot. Throughout the time it was developed, the main plot core underwent a lot of changes, although some key elements remained through all the process, mainly the principal plot element (the return of an astronaut to Earth after a long trip to the Moon). After the reading of "Poetics for Cosmonauts", the script changed to its present form. The preproduction for the short film started in October–November 2008. In January 2009, the project underwent its most radical changes: the film went from being a short film released and produced in a traditional way, to a feature-length film funded through Crowdfunding and released for free under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License. Inspired by productions such as "A Swarm of Angels" and "Artemis Eternal", "The Cosmonaut" is the first Spanish feature film that makes use of the crowdfunding financing method. There were two ways to get involved in "The Cosmonaut"’s production: Being a cinematographic project whose spread is based mostly in the use of social networks, and synergy between audience and creators, the network material of the movie is centered mostly in the creation of a fan community. Producers, regardless of their monetary participation in the film, form part of "Programme K", a social group in which they can relate between each other, follow the development of the film, and take advantage of special perks and draws for Programme K members. The film, when finished, will be released on the Internet available for download and in HD. Also, besides the full movie on HD, all raw footage shot during the movie's filming will be uploaded too. As the film is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-ShareAlike License, the users will be able to download, lend, re-cut or use the film footage in any way they wish. This way, the audience not only will be allowed, but also encouraged by the producers themselves, to create new versions of the film and other derivative works. Between December 2009 and June 2010, the Riot Cinema team worked in modernizing the previous business model. On 2 June 2010, the new model, called “The Plan”, was launched in a press conference by the people in charge of the company. It provides the project with some developments. These developments increase the project approach and infrastructure, keeping its previous features, but, in general, taking them a step further. A totally new funding plan is introduced in the business model. While in the old model the film funding was through crowdfunding and private investment, in “The Plan”, a three-staged progressive plan is detailed, in which there is room for private financing, crowdfunding, sponsorization, and distribution presales. Even though the new three-staged model (in which the first stage would be the first year of the project) keeps crowdfunding and private investment as funding means, their role in the project varies: economically, crowdfunding carries less weight than in the first draft of the project. Nevertheless, its use is kept due to the weight such a completely developed infrastructure has in keeping and strengthening a fan community. Regarding private investment, it keeps the same operational system, but the owned profits per invested money ratio vary depending on the project stage. According to Riot Cinema data, of the €860,000 the project will cost, it is expected that 6.5% be financed through crowdfunding and/or merchandising, 21% by private investment, 32% through sponsorship, and 40.5% through presales distribution (approximate figures). One of the examples of the application of the new sponsorship option was available in the party carried out during the 2010 Yuri's Night. Since Yuri Gagarin is a kind of mascot of the project, the people in charge of the film worked in collaboration with LEEM for months in order to join the world initiatives celebrated in Yuri's Night. It also happened to celebrate the achievement of 2000 producers of the film. In the same way, the movie distribution model has also changed. The project has suffered more noticeable changes in its distribution channels and in the final completion of the project. Regarding distribution, the new plan's objective is the simultaneous premiere in all release windows. The philosophy behind this decision is to allow the user to choose the format he wants to watch the movie. Different particularities have been adopted for each release window, taking each mean into account, but making some changes in the traditional way of distribution. For instance, the release on the Internet will still be totally free and in HD, while the TV release will have an alternative ending for that channel. In the same way, the people in charge of the movie have designed a special presentation in cinemas to encourage people to go the theaters. This is called “The Cosmonaut Experience”, and it merges performance elements with recreational interaction with the audience, classic screening and a traveling tour, in order to provide the audience, according to the creators, with an added "experience". This tour of screenings will not replace the traditional screening in cinemas, but it will be done at the same time. The Cosmonaut, regarding its current completion, is no longer a science fiction feature film. Following the steps of franchises such as The Matrix or Lost, The Cosmonaut will be a transmedia project with ramifications in different fields. It is planned to make a series of webisodes, mobile content, or even an ARG, among others. Each series of content will show its own perspective of a story included in the film. It won't be necessary to watch them in order to understand the given facts, but it will provide some data and information about The Cosmonaut world that will complement each other. An update of the business model ("The Plan 2") was presented in October 2011, once shooting was finished. The Cosmonaut is one of the most successful crowdfunding projects in history with about €300,000. After having raised €120,000 during the first two years, the decision was taken to shoot with that money together with €120,000 more contributed by a Russian co-producer. One week before shooting, when all the tickets were purchased and all the reservations made, the co-producer had to withdraw. A desperate campaign was then launched requesting the community to help save the movie. More than 600 people contributed a total of €131,000 in 3 days, beating all the world crowdfunding records in such a short period of time, and allowing the film to be shot. With such a huge success, the possibility of investing was kept during the entirety of shooting. A streaming window was created so the investors could watch the shooting they had made possible live. Lánzanos, the Spanish crowdfunding platform that collaborated during the whole campaign, faced, together with The Cosmonaut's team, what they called "their most beautiful failure of design": the raising status bar exceeded 173%, going beyond the box it was embedded in. The same happened on the film website. After over a year of promotion, the project has received certain degree of attention from the national media in Spain. There have been reports about the film in various of the non-"pay per view" television channels of the country: TVE, in the news program of LaSexta, CNN+ and Cuatro, and in a divulgative program of La 2. [20]; as well as in different newspapers, magazines and radios: El País, El Mundo, ABC, Público, AND, La Gaceta, Fotogramas, Cadena Ser, los 40 Principales. We can also find among these the Spanish edition of Cahiers du Cinema. The main coverage of the project, however, came through the Internet. A great quantity of blogs and web based media dedicated articles to the film, between them some of the most influential blogs of Spain. Some examples of this include the digital version of El País, the daily newspaper with the biggest print run in the country, or Microsiervos, one of the most visited blogs in Spanish. The media reaction wasn't limited to Spain: some English-speaking blogs wrote about the project as well. Most of the media attention towards the project was generated after a two-day music festival. The festival, named "CosmoNauts", was announced in The Cosmonaut blog on 9 June 2009. It was organized as a mass event to promote the film; during two days (29 and 30 June), nine bands belonging to the indie scene of Madrid played in front of an audience that, according to the organization, reached 400 people between the two days, with the emerging filmmaker Nacho Vigalondo as the master of ceremonies. The concert, held in Madrid in the Sala Heineken, wasn't able to fill the seating capacity of the concert hall, mainly due to schedule hardships (the concert was held in the middle of a working week, and at the end of the month), and the organization's inexperience. While it was a mild economic failure, the organizers of the concert ascribe the subsequent promotional success of the movie and the later peak of sales in the online store to the festival, and, therefore, consider it a success. The Cosmonaut team, in collaboration with Improba Spain (the collective of followers of Improv Everywhere in Spain), carried out a promotional flashmob on 29 January 2010, in Puerta del Sol, Madrid. The object of the event was to simulate a moon landing in downtown Madrid, and it had a remarkable attendance, even some of the passers-by joined the performance. The crowdfunding movie project "The Cosmonaut" has suffered a serious PR drawback due to a public relationship problem related to the director and writer, Nicolás Alcalá. In his response (which he made public) to a resume from a man named "Carlos", Alcalá made some very peculiar remarks about the structure of the email and its purpose. Thus, with the intention of humiliating this man, he made comments, such as: ""If you are a fishmonger, tell us, we have a job for you."" (It can be read in Spanish here.) Spanish social media responded very harshly to the public comment, with multiple reactions across the web, and thousands of angry responses on their blogs, leading to a public declaration from the director where he made a public apology for his comments. 

The Renault 80 hp, or Type WS in British service, was a V-8 aero engine that first ran in 1914. The engine was manufactured in Britain by Renault Limited of West Brompton, London between August 1914 and December 1918, seven other companies, including Rolls-Royce and Brazil Straker, also produced the engine. The Renault V-8 engines were noted as inefficient but reliable, the inefficiency being mainly due to the excessively rich fuel/air mixture used to assist cooling.

Thomas Turner (September, 1645 – 29 April 1714) was an English churchman and academic, Archdeacon of Essex and President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford. The second son of Thomas Turner, Dean of Canterbury, he was born at Bristol on 19 or 20 September 1645; he was a younger brother of Francis Turner. Thomas originally matriculated at Hart Hall on 10 May 1662, but on 6 October 1663 he was admitted to a Gloucestershire scholarship at Corpus, of which he became fellow in 1672. He graduated B.A. on 15 March 1666, M.A. in 1669, B.D. in 1677, and D.D. in 1683. From 1672 to 1695 he was vicar of Milton, near Sittingbourne, Kent, and from 1680 to 1689 rector of Thorley, Hertfordshire. He became rector of Fulham, Middlesex, in 1688, archdeacon of Essex in 1680, canon of Ely in 1686, canon of St Paul's Cathedral in 1682, and precentor in 1690. These preferments, except the sinecure rectory of Fulham and the canonry and precentorship of St. Paul's, he resigned at or shortly after his election to the presidency of Corpus on 13 March 1688. The rapid election, which took place within a week of the death of his predecessor Robert Newlyn, diminished the chance of any interference from the court of James II. Turner reformed the college and spent his own money on it. In 1706 he began what are now the Fellows' buildings, to a design attributed to Henry Aldrich. They were completed in 1712. Turner died on 29 April 1714, and is buried in the college chapel, where, as also at Stowe Nine Churches in Northamptonshire, there is a lengthy inscription about his bequests. These included a major benefaction to the Corporation of the Sons of the Clergy. Turner was, from the hints of Thomas Hearne, suspected of Jacobite sympathies, but on very slender grounds. His publication was a sermon preached at Whitehall on 29 May 1685 before James II, to whom he was chaplain. In this sermon there is criticism of Thomas Hobbes's position, that a 'state of nature is a state of war.' 

"Hypnotized" is a song written by Bob Welch. The song originally featured on Fleetwood Mac's 1973 album "Mystery To Me". The track was released on a single as the B-side of "For Your Love", and has been described as "gorgeous and lyrically strong", and referred to as the album's best track. The song features triple time rhythm on the drums by Mick Fleetwood and combines with acoustic guitar and electric keyboards. Welch draws upon the use of jazz fourth chords in the song playing in a minor key and also features a guitar solo by Bob Weston covering many octaves. Hypnosis and dreaming are specifically referred to in the lyrics, and Welch also draws upon references to places such as Mexico and North Carolina. According to Welch, the atmosphere of the song was heavily influenced by his residence at the Benifold Mansion in Hampshire, England, a place he described as "rather spooky and strange even in summertime". In 1978 the song was covered by the Pointer Sisters on their album "Energy". Donald Brackett, in his 2007 book "Fleetwood Mac, 40 Years of Creative Chaos", discussed the album "Mystery To Me" and the song "Hypnotized" which he described as "a gentle yet compelling hit for Welch on this record". In discussing Fleetwood Mac's change in direction in 1972 and 1973, he describes their stylistic changes as being better received at concerts in the United States, as at the time Americans were more open to them than the British who were still in heavy demand for blues-oriented rock. Hal Horowitz describes the song as "the highlight of the "Mystery to Me" album, and undoubtedly one of Bob Welch's most fully realized songs for the band". In 1999 Welch received an award from ASCAP recognizing 25 consecutive years of airplay for "Hypnotized" and "Sentimental Lady".

Three Miles North of Molkom is a 2008 documentary film directed by Corinna Villari-McFarlane and Robert Cannan. It was nominated in the Best British Documentary category for the British Independent Film Awards 2008. It follows seven participants of the 2007 No Mind Festival at Ängsbacka, a course center located in Molkom, Sweden. This yearly New Age event lasts one or two weeks, has a thousand participants, and is claimed to be the largest alternative festival in Northern Europe. The activities shown in the film include tree hugging (each one choosing his own tree), firewalking, nude swimming, sweat lodge, hugging, Tantric sex, singing, dancing, talks in "sharing circles". There is also an exercise in defending oneself against a physical attack using psychic energy. The portrayed participants are: "Three Miles North of Molkom" is a low-budget film. Permission to film at the festival came only four weeks in advance. The crew consisted of the two directors and two camera men. Use is made of a Fig Rig. While other groups at the festival are formed at random, this group consisted of people willing and accepted to be in the film. Six of the seven participants were selected during the first six hours of the festival. Nick initially did not care whether he was filmed or not, he just wanted to hang out with the crew because to him they were the closest thing to normality around him. Regina Lund, who had announced that she was interested, was accepted after her arrival on the second day. 150 hours of film was shot. There was no time to watch the rushes during the festival. 

Joseph Charles Buttler (born 8 September 1990) is an English international cricketer who is currently vice-captain of the England cricket team in limited overs cricket. A right-handed batsman, he usually fields as a wicket-keeper and has represented England in Test, One Day International (ODI) and Twenty20 International (T20I) cricket. He served as vice-captain of the England squad that won the 2019 Cricket World Cup, becoming world champions for the first time in their history. He currently plays for Lancashire in English domestic cricket having previously played for Somerset. He also plays for Rajasthan Royals in the Indian Premier League (IPL). Buttler holds the record for the fastest ODI century by an England player and is regarded as one of the best wicket-keeper batsmen in the world. Buttler's ability to recognise and manipulate field placements of opposing teams and score all around the ground has seen him labelled as a "360-degree" cricketer. Buttler enjoyed a prolific cricket record while at school, sharing a record-breaking opening partnership while at King's College, Taunton in 2008. The following season, his school lost only one of seventeen matches under his captaincy and he was named 2010 "Young Wisden" Schools Cricketer of the Year. He made his Somerset first-team debut in 2009 after having played age-group cricket for the county. His performances led him to be selected to play for England at Under-19 level before he made his senior England debut in 2011 and his Test debut in 2014. Born in Taunton, Somerset, on 8 September 1990, Buttler was educated at King's College, where he displayed his early talent in cricket. Buttler played extensively for Somerset's youth teams, appearing at Under-13, Under-15 and Under-17 level. He made his senior club cricket debut for Cheddar before moving to Glastonbury in the 2006 season, aged just 15, taking three catches and 15 runs as wicket-keeper. Later in the same season, he made his first appearance for Somerset Second XI, scoring 71 in the second-innings, and taking six catches in the three-day match against Nottinghamshire Second XI. Playing for King's College, he finished the 2006 season with the school's leading batting average, scoring 447 runs at an average of 49.66. The following season he played regularly for Glastonbury in the West of England Premier League, and for Somerset Under-17s, for whom he scored two centuries; an unbeaten 119 during a two-day match against Surrey Under-17s, and 110 against Sussex Under-17s. He once again led the batting averages for King's College, with his 358 runs coming at 51.14. The highlight of his school career came in April 2008, when he scored 227 not out during a record-breaking opening stand in a 50-over national schools game, adding 340 with Alex Barrow. He captained King's during the 2008 season, and improved on his batting totals from the previous two years, scoring 851 runs, over 250 more than any other member of the team. His batting average of 94.55 was the sixth highest amongst all school's batsmen reported in "Wisden", while his high-score of 227* was the highest score they recorded. During that 2008 season, Buttler also played for Somerset Second XI. With captain Carl Gazzard keeping wicket in the majority of these matches, Buttler played purely as a batsman, although in his final match of the season for the team, he kept wicket and took six catches in the first-innings against Worcestershire Second XI. In the previous match, against Hampshire Second XI, Buttler had made 140 batting from number four. He made his first-class debut for Somerset in September 2009, replacing the injured Justin Langer for the County Championship match against Lancashire, scoring 30 in his only innings. He retained his place in the team for the following Pro40 match against Hampshire, making his List A debut, although he was not required to bat. Selected as part of the Somerset squad for the 2009 Champions League Twenty20, Buttler made his debut in the 20-over format of the game in Somerset's final match of the league stage, remaining six not out at the close of the innings. Buttler again captained King's in 2009, and in the seventeen matches under his leadership they lost only once, and also won the Western School Twenty20 competition. Coupled with his 554 runs for the school at an average of 61.55, and his performances for Somerset, he was named 2010 "Young Wisden" Schools Cricketer of the Year. When Craig Kieswetter was called up into the England one-day side in 2010, Buttler was given the chance of a prolonged run in Somerset's first team. Brian Rose, Somerset's Director of Cricket, chose not to bring in an experienced keeper to deputise, explaining that Kieswetter had been in a similar position three years earlier and that he had good reports of Buttler's ability. In his first match of the 2010 season, Buttler remained 22 not out at the close of Somerset's innings, posting his first runs in List A cricket, and he followed this up with two catches to help Somerset beat Glamorgan in their opening Clydesdale Bank 40 fixture. He made his maiden first-class century in his fourth County Championship match, scoring 144 runs in an innings characterised by "dogged determination and [a] decent range of shots". In his next match, he scored his debut List A half-century against Sussex. Buttler joined James Hildreth at the crease with Somerset at 109/4, requiring 183 more runs to win off 129 balls. The pair put on a partnership of 158 runs "to turn the game on its head", with Buttler making 69 in 53 balls. In doing so, they set a new record partnership for the fifth-wicket against Sussex. His continued good batting form, which also saw him make scores of 52 and 31* in a County Championship match against Yorkshire, saw him retain his place in the Somerset team upon Kieswetter's return. Buttler was named Man of the Match in Somerset's 2010 Friends Provident T20 semi-final victory over Nottinghamshire at the Rose Bowl, reaching a "breathtaking" half-century from 21 balls to score an unbeaten 55 runs in a partnership of 75 with Kieron Pollard. His aggressive batting won him many plaudits and helped Somerset reach the final of the 2010 Clydesdale Bank 40 as well as the Twenty20 cup. His good form with the bat continued into 2011 as Somerset again reached the final of both the T20 and 40 over competitions, with Buttler top-scoring with a "mature" 86 runs from 72 balls in the 40 over final. In both 2010 and 2011 he was awarded the NBC Denis Compton Award as Somerset's most promising young player and made his full England debut at the end of the season. The 2012 season proved similarly productive for Buttler, and featured a "brilliant" half-century scored from 36 balls against Northamptonshire in the domestic 40 over competition, although increasing international call-ups limited his appearances for Somerset and Kieswetter remained the first-choice wicket-keeper for Somerset. The second County Championship match of the 2013 season saw Buttler score 94 runs playing as a specialist batsman and an injury to Kieswetter at the end of April provided an opportunity for Buttler to claim his place as wicket-keeper in the side. Somerset started the County Championship season poorly, but Buttler was praised for adopting a mature approach to his batting, averaging over 40 with the bat in the Championship at the midpoint of the season and enjoying his most productive first-class season to date. After missing county matches again due to international call-ups, Buttler saw Kieswetter return as wicket-keeper in some T20 county matches and began to publicly question his future at the club if he was not to keep wicket regularly for the one-day side. He delayed signing a new contract he had been offered, concerned that by not being the main wicket-keeper for Somerset that he would put his international wicket-keeping place in jeopardy, despite a strong emotional attachment to the county. Despite Somerset's desire to keep Buttler at the club, they were unable to reach an agreement which satisfied Buttler's desire to keep wicket, and at the end of the season he announced that he would be leaving Somerset with the aim of securing his international place and breaking into the England Test side. At the end of September 2013, Lancashire announced they had signed Buttler. He scored 42 in his first Championship appearance for the county before compiling a "game-changing" innings of 72 on a difficult pitch at Northampton. This showcased Buttler's first-class batting potential and contributed to a record seventh wicket partnership for Lancashire against Northants. He scored his first century for Lancashire (his fourth in first-class cricket) in June against Durham before equalling the record for the fastest fifty scored in T20 cricket, hitting a half-century in 22 balls against Northants on his way to 58 not out in the 2014 NatWest t20 Blast. Lancashire finished runners-up of the T20 competition, losing to Warwickshire in the final. He played 10 first-class matches for Lancashire during the season and was called into the England Test side as wicket-keeper in July, replacing the injured Matt Prior, although doubts remained about the quality of his wicket-keeping. He extended his stay with Lancashire, announcing a new three-year contract on 27 May 2016. Buttler's first taste of international cricket came in July 2008, when he represented England Under-17s in two warm-up matches against New Zealand Under-19s. Batting at number five, he scored a rapid 77 not out in the 50-over contest, hitting 11 fours and two sixes during the 49 deliveries he faced. He also played in the two-day match between the two teams, scoring 45 in the first-innings as the match was drawn. In 2009, Buttler played four matches for England Under-18s, two each against Scotland A and Scotland Development XI. He scored 103 not out in the first of these matches, and made starts in each of the following matches, reaching double figures on each occasion, but not scoring higher than 28. Two months later, Buttler made his England Under-19 debut, appearing in the first T20 against Bangladesh Under-19s. Playing as a specialist batsman, he scored 33 runs off 17 balls as England won by five wickets. During the 2009–10 English winter, Buttler toured with the England Under-19 team. He joined up with the squad in Bangladesh following Somerset's elimination from the Champions League Twenty20 for the seven-match youth One Day International (ODI) series, playing again as a specialist batsman. He failed to make a significant impact until the final match when he top-scored for England with 42 runs. He remained with the team for the Under-19 World Cup, where he played all but one of England's six matches, keeping wicket in three of them. He scored 91 runs in three innings, with a top-score of 78 against India in the fifth-place play-off semi-final. His batting average of 30.33 ranked him fifth on the England team. Buttler was called into the senior England squad for the Twenty20 International (T20I) against the touring Indian team in September 2011. He made his debut for the side in the match as a specialist batsman before going on to play against the touring West Indies side later the same season. During the winter of 2011 he was part of the England performance programme for batting and wicket-keeping in India, and played in the England Lions tours of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka, scoring his maiden limited-overs century against Sri Lanka A in January 2012. He played a T20I against India in Kolkata and then toured with England to play Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates in early 2012, making his ODI debut, although he was out second ball without scoring. Buttler continued to play regular T20 cricket for England throughout 2012. Against South Africa at Edgbaston, he joined Somerset teammate Craig Kieswetter with England on 64/3 with only 16 balls remaining. The pair gave "a brutal display of power hitting", raising the final score to 118/5, with Buttler hitting 30 runs from one 32-run over from Wayne Parnell, the second most productive over in International T20 at the time. The innings established Buttler as a key part of the England one-day side; he had made 10 appearances before the match but reached double figures only once in his six innings, and his performance made him "one of the most talked-about players" in the England side. Buttler spoke about how the innings made him feel "calmer, more myself, more relaxed" and he received an ECB incremental contract later in the same month. He was selected for the England squad for the 2012 ICC World Twenty20, playing in all five of England's matches in the competition, although he scored only 40 runs in his five innings. Buttler replaced a rested Jonathan Trott in the England ODI squad in India in early 2013 and replaced Craig Kieswetter as the first-choice wicket-keeper halfway through the ODI series. This allowed Buttler to break into the England ODI side on a consistent basis, playing regularly throughout the year in both ODI and T20 formats and increasingly as a wicket-keeper, despite some reservations about the quality of his work behind the stumps. He scored his maiden half-century for England in a T20 warm-up match at the start of England's tour of New Zealand followed by his first T20I half-century in the second match of the series. After being confirmed as England's first-choice limited-overs wicket-keeper, he played in every match in the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy in England. For his performances in 2013, he was named in the T20I XI by Cricinfo. Buttler played again in the 2014 ICC World Twenty20 in Bangladesh in March and played regular one-day cricket throughout the year. He scored his maiden ODI century against Sri Lanka at Lord's in May, scoring 121 in 61 balls with nine fours and four sixes, the then-fastest century by any England batsman. During the fifth ODI of the series at Edgbaston, Buttler was controversially 'Mankaded' by Sachithra Senanayake, leading to tension between the sides. England captain Alastair Cook expressed his disappointment, stating: "I've never seen it before in a game. I was pretty disappointed. If he was properly trying to steal the single then I could possibly understand it. But he was half a yard out of his crease.". After first choice wicket-keeper Matt Prior stood down after injury on 22 July 2014, Buttler was called up for the England squad for the third Test against India. He made 85 runs from 83 balls in his first Test innings. He played in the final three Tests of the series before reverting to one-day duty, touring Sri Lanka at the end of the year. After playing for England in the Tri-series in Australia at the start of the year, Buttler was once again involved with England at an international tournament, playing in the 2015 Cricket World Cup in Australia and New Zealand. He scored an unbeaten 39 in 19 balls against Sri Lanka and made 65 against Bangladesh but ultimately England lost both matches in a disastrous campaign, failing to progress beyond the group stages. Later in the English winter he was called back into the Test side, as wicket-keeper, during the tour of the West Indies. He continued in the role throughout the English summer, playing both Tests against New Zealand and all five Ashes Tests against Australia. Buttler's batting during the Ashes series was criticised by Geoffrey Boycott, who stated: He continued to play one-day cricket alongside his Test role, making his then-highest ODI score of 129 from 77 balls against New Zealand. After playing in the first two Tests against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates during October, Buttler was dropped for the third Test, replaced as wicket-keeper by Jonny Bairstow, and was not selected for any of the Test matches during England's tour of South Africa, although he did play again in the one-day fixtures during the tour. In the fourth ODI against Pakistan in Dubai in November, he scored a 46-ball century, the fastest ODI hundred by an England player. Buttler again played for England in the 2016 ICC World Twenty20 and was a regular fixture in the limited-overs squad throughout the year. He scored an unbeaten 90 runs against Pakistan as part of an England record score of 444/3, the fastest half-century by an Englishman. Both records have since been surpassed. Buttler captained the England side in the ODI series against Bangladesh in October 2016 after numerous players, including regular captain Eoin Morgan, declined to tour over raised security concerns following a terrorist attack in Dhaka in July. In the second ODI, there was some controversy as Buttler was involved in a heated exchange with numerous Bangladesh players following his dismissal to Taskin Ahmed. Buttler, aggravated by the opposition's excessive celebrations, turned to confront them, resulting in him being ushered away by the umpires. Following the incident, Buttler was reprimanded by the International Cricket Council (ICC) and received one demerit point to his disciplinary record, while Bangladesh captain Mashrafe Mortaza and Sabbir Rahman were each fined 20% of their match fees and given a demerit point. Buttler was again reserve wicket-keeper for the Test series against Bangladesh. He returned to the England Test side for the third Test against India in November, playing in the final three Tests of the series. He continued as a regular in the limited-overs side throughout 2016 and 2017, playing again for England in the 2017 ICC Champions Trophy, but was unable to break back into the Test side and was not selected for the 2017–18 Ashes series in Australia. He was named in the ICC World ODI XI in 2016. In May 2018, Buttler was recalled into England's Test squad to play Pakistan at Lord's later that month. He had a successful return to Test cricket, scoring two half-centuries and scoring the most runs in the series; he also won the Man of the Match award at Headingley. In the subsequent ODI series against Australia in June 2018, he scored two half-centuries in the first four matches and then, in the fifth and final game of the series, he made 110 not out to take England to a historic series whitewash. In this match, no other English batsman made more than 20 and Buttler was afterwards described as "the best white-ball wicketkeeper batsman in the world". Buttler was named Man of the Match for his 110 not out, and also named Man of the Series for his impressive contributions with both bat and gloves. In the T20I match of Australia's tour, Buttler scored the fastest T20I half-century by an English cricketer, in 22 balls. Buttler replaced James Anderson as the Test vice-captain on 31 July 2018, thus combining the role in all formats. He registered his maiden Test century in the third Test of India's tour of England in August 2018, with a score of 106. Buttler then retained his place in the Test and one-day squads, being selected to tour Sri Lanka in October and into the following year. In February 2019, during the fourth ODI of England's tour of the West Indies, Buttler scored a career-best 150 from 77 deliveries as England reached 418/6. During this innings, he hit 12 sixes, at the time the most by any English batsman in an ODI, and went from 51 to 100 in just 15 balls and from 100 to 150 in just 16 deliveries. This was part of an England world record for the most sixes in an ODI, with 24. Following the innings, West Indian batsman Chris Gayle praised Buttler, stating, "He is superb, one of the best strikers [of the ball] in world cricket today... We can see he is a game-winner, a game-changer and every team needs a player like that to win games.", while England captain Eoin Morgan described him as "built like a champion racehorse". In the second ODI of the five-match series against Pakistan in May, Buttler scored an unbeaten 110 from 55 balls, his century coming in only 50 deliveries. This is the second fastest hundred by an English batsman in ODI cricket after his own record set against Pakistan in 2015. In April 2019, he was named as the vice-captain of the England squad for the 2019 Cricket World Cup. The ICC named Buttler as the key player of England's squad prior to the tournament. Buttler made a quiet start to the tournament, scoring only 18 runs in the opening match of the tournament against South Africa at The Oval, which ended in a comprehensive 104-run win for England. In the next match against Pakistan, he scored 103 from 76 balls (the then-fastest century by an English batsman in a World Cup) and shared a 130-run partnership with Joe Root for the fourth wicket, despite a shock 14-run defeat. He made 64 in the third match against Bangladesh as England posted 386/6, their highest ever World Cup score. However, he did not keep wicket during Bangladesh's innings after sustaining a minor hip injury while batting, making way for Jonny Bairstow to assume the role for the match, which England won by 106 runs. Buttler scored 59 runs in the final against New Zealand and contributed to a crucial 110-run partnership with Ben Stokes to help tie the match, with both teams making 241 from their respective innings. He was selected to bat in the ensuing Super Over along with Stokes, from which the pair scored 15 runs; Buttler scoring seven with a boundary from the final ball. He completed the run out of Martin Guptill on the last ball of New Zealand's over as he attempted a match-winning second run. This tied the Super Over and secured England's maiden World Cup title, winning by a superior boundary count. In July 2019, following England's World Cup success, the ECB named Buttler in the fourteen-man Test squad for the upcoming Ashes series. On 29 May 2020, Buttler was named in a 55-man group of players to begin training ahead of international fixtures starting in England following the COVID-19 pandemic. On 17 June 2020, Buttler was included in England's 30-man squad to start training behind closed doors for the Test series against the West Indies. On 4 July 2020, Buttler was named in England's thirteen-man squad for the first Test match of the series. Buttler has become increasingly involved in playing franchise T20 cricket around the world, and has been described as arguably England's "first ever global Twenty20 superstar". Buttler's first experience of franchise cricket came in 2013/14 when he played for Melbourne Renegades in the 2013–14 Big Bash League season in Australia. This coincided with the buildup to the England one-day side playing in Australia at the beginning of 2014 and followed him having been with the England development squad in Perth for a month prior to the start of the competition. Buttler was initially only expected to play for Melbourne in their first two matches of the competition but this was extended due to the late arrival of Pakistani all-rounder Mohammad Hafeez, who had been called into the Pakistan Test squad. After having scored a "stunning" 61 runs against Brisbane Heat in his third match, Buttler eventually played in five Big Bash matches for Melbourne before leaving to join the England squad. Buttler played for Mumbai Indians in the 2016 and 2017 Indian Premier League (IPL) seasons. Expecting to be left out of the 2017–18 Ashes series in Australia, Buttler signed a two-year contract in August 2017 with Comilla Victorians to appear in the Bangladesh Premier League (BPL). He made his BPL debut in November 2017, scoring 48 runs from 42 balls in his second match for Comilla and recorded his first BPL half-century in his third match. In November 2017, Buttler was signed as an overseas player for Sydney Thunder for the upcoming Big Bash League season. He played in the first six games for Thunder before joining the England squad for the limited-over fixtures of England's tour of Australia. He scored 67 and 81 in separate games against Hobart Hurricanes, being named Player of the Match in the first fixture. In January 2018, Buttler was bought by the Rajasthan Royals in the 2018 IPL auction for . Buttler had a difficult start for the Royals, making a high score of just 29 in his first seven innings. However, on being promoted to open the batting mid-tournament, his performances significantly improved. He subsequently became only the second batsman in IPL history to achieve five scores of fifty or more in consecutive matches. He made an unbeaten 95 from 60 balls against Chennai Super Kings, his highest score in the T20 format to date. Buttler again played for Sydney Thunder in the 2018–19 Big Bash League, this time alongside England teammate Joe Root. The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) allowed Buttler and Root to play the first half of the season, despite a busy international schedule throughout 2019. Buttler made his highest BBL score of 89 from 54 deliveries against Hobart Hurricanes, despite a seven-wicket defeat, before making 55 in a thrilling one-run win over Perth Scorchers. Buttler departed as the tournament's leading run-scorer, with 273 from seven innings, making three half-centuries at an average of 39.00. Rajasthan Royals retained Buttler for the 2019 IPL season. In a match between Rajasthan Royals and Kings XI Punjab, Buttler was controversially run out on 69 by Indian bowler Ravichandran Ashwin via 'Mankading', an act that Ashwin was heavily criticised for. Former Australian bowler and Rajasthan mentor Shane Warne called the incident a "disgraceful and low act". This is the second instance in which Buttler has been dismissed in this fashion, the other occasion in an ODI match for England against Sri Lanka in 2014. In his next two matches for Rajasthan, he was dismissed for scores of just five and six but returned to form after hitting 59 from 43 balls in a fixture against Royal Challengers Bangalore. He also made a score of 89 from 43 deliveries against Mumbai Indians, hitting 28 runs off the 13th over. In October 2017, Buttler married Louise Webber. England teammates Steven Finn and Alex Hales acted as ushers for the wedding. Their daughter, Georgia Rose, was born in April 2019. Buttler was appointed Member of the Order of the British Empire (MBE) in the 2020 New Year Honours for services to cricket. A tall and strongly-built cricketer, Buttler has an upright stance in the crease. During his maiden first-class century against Hampshire in 2010, he "hit the ball hard and straight", "moving his feet decisively, playing with his bat close to his body and selecting the right balls to attack". Buttler was praised for "remaining cool and composed at the crease" and for his "dogged determination and decent range of shots" during the innings. Somerset captain Marcus Trescothick suggested that Buttler could challenge teammate Craig Kieswetter's place in the England team. Buttler's temperament in the longer forms of the game has been questioned at times as his career has developed. In 2013, he was out for 94 runs for Somerset while attempting to reach his century by hitting a six and George Dobell, writing for ESPNcricinfo, questioned "his ability to defend and deny [bowlers]". Dobell praised the first half of Buttler's innings, which ensured a draw for Somerset, saying that "it showed a young man responding to his team's needs with a restrained, mature performance that exhibited a decent defence and an ability to leave and play straight" and that he had "produced some of those trademark straight drives and several powerful pulls" but felt that "it is the strokes he does not play that are as relevant as those he does". In one day cricket, Buttler quickly established a reputation as an aggressive batsman who could take control of a game at the end of an innings. By the end of his first full-season he was producing "innings of huge promise" which were being described as "breathtaking" and "swashbuckling" and displaying "an array of explosive and innovative shots". Still a teenager, his displays in both 40 over and 20 over cricket in 2010 won him plaudits, including a description as a "supremely talented youngster" who batted with a "blend of power and sweet timing". His range of shots, including effective use of 'scoop' and 'ramp' shots over the wicket-keeper to fine leg and variations such as reverse and swivel scoop shots, mean that his game has been considered subtle rather than overly aggressive and his "stunning strokes", clean striking and "crispness when hitting" the ball along with his "audacity and adventure" have all been cited as making him an "exciting" batsman. Despite not always being his county's first-choice wicket-keeper and reservations about the quality of his work behind the stumps, Buttler has frequently been used in that role by the England team since the beginning of 2013, especially in one-day cricket. He was installed in the wicket-keeper role ahead of the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy after Craig Kieswetter faltered in terms of his batting – Buttler's one-day batting, his potential and his ability to combine power with improvisation being seen as more important than any failings as a wicket-keeper – despite, by his own admission, his "keeping [being] a work in progress". His wicket-keeping was "seen by some as having more potential" than his main rival for the job Jonny Bairstow and England wicket-keeper coach Bruce French spoke of his "natural hands" behind the stumps. Following Kieswetter's and Matt Prior's international retirements in 2015, Buttler became England's first-choice wicket-keeper in all formats. Whether he should play as a wicket-keeper or specialist batsman was questioned in middle of the 2015 season and Bairstow replaced him for the third ODI during Australia's 2015 tour due to Buttler's poor form with the bat throughout the Australian series. Bairstow eventually became the outright wicket-keeper for Tests in December 2015 for the series against South Africa, and Buttler was dropped from the Test side during 2016, whilst continuing to be the first-choice ODI and T20 wicket-keeper. , Buttler has scored five first-class and 11 List A centuries, nine of which have been scored for England in One Day International matches. He is yet to score a century in the T20 format of the game. Buttler made his maiden first-class century in May 2010, scoring 144 for Somerset against Hampshire at the Rose Bowl, Southampton. this remains his highest first-class score. His highest Test match score of 106 was made for England against India in August 2018 at Trent Bridge, Nottingham. In limited overs cricket, Buttler's best List A and ODI score of 150 from 77 deliveries was made in February 2019 against the West Indies at the National Cricket Stadium, Grenada. This is also the highest ODI score for an Englishman against the West Indies. Buttler is yet to score a century in one-day matches in county cricket. Buttler's highest T20 score of 95 not out from 60 balls was made for Rajasthan Royals against Chennai Super Kings in the 2018 Indian Premier League at the Sawai Mansingh Stadium, Jaipur. His highest T20I score is 73 not out off 49 balls, and was achieved against Sri Lanka in July 2016 at the Rose Bowl, Southampton. 

Adult Contemporary is a chart published by "Billboard" ranking the top-performing songs in the United States in the adult contemporary music (AC) genre. In 1988, 22 songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Adult Contemporary, based on playlists submitted by radio stations. In the year's first issue of "Billboard" the number one song was "Got My Mind Set on You" by George Harrison, which was in its third week at number one. It held the top spot for two weeks in 1988 before being displaced by "Everywhere" by British-American rock group Fleetwood Mac. In March, actor Patrick Swayze reached number one with the song "She's Like the Wind", featuring Wendy Fraser, taken from the soundtrack of the film "Dirty Dancing", in which he starred. It was the second AC chart-topper from the film, following "(I've Had) The Time of My Life" by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes, which had reached number one the previous year. British singer Phil Collins topped the chart with two songs from the soundtrack of the film "Buster", in which he played the lead role, reaching the top spot with his rendition of the 1960s song "A Groovy Kind of Love" and the original track "Two Hearts". Gloria Estefan and her band Miami Sound Machine were the only act to have three number ones during the year, but they were the final three hits on which Miami Sound Machine received separate billing; all Estefan's subsequent hits were credited to her alone. The Latin-influenced group spent a total of five weeks at number one, tying with Whitney Houston and Phil Collins for the most time spent atop the chart by an act during 1988. Collins and Houston each achieved their total with two number ones; British vocalists Rick Astley and George Michael were the only other acts with multiple chart toppers during the year. The year's longest unbroken run at number one was achieved by Peter Cetera, whose song "One Good Woman" spent four weeks in the top spot in the fall. Chicago, the group which Cetera had fronted for nearly two decades before leaving in 1985, achieved its first number one since his departure when "Look Away" spent a single week in the top spot in December. The final Hot Adult Contemporary number one of 1988 was "Two Hearts" by Phil Collins, which held the top spot for the last two weeks of the year.

The Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy is a pharmacy school and an academic division of the University of Toronto. The faculty is located on the northwestern corner of College Street and University Avenue, placing it across from the Ontario Legislative Building and at the entrance to Queen's Park station. It is also situated 1-2 blocks away from four internationally renowned hospitals — The Hospital for Sick Children, Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, Toronto General Hospital and Mount Sinai Hospital. It is part of Toronto's Discovery District. The Faculty of Pharmacy Building is particularly notable for its two orb-shaped classrooms, referred to as the "pods", which are suspended lecture halls. The pods are lit at night with coloured stage lights visible from afar, giving the building a "Star Trek feel". Likened to giant glowing pills, the pods are reason #113 to love Toronto, and have been deemed "something of a local landmark." The Pharmacy Building has received international coverage and awards, in part because of its design team, including world-famous Sir Norman Foster and Claude Engle, as well as its high-profile sponsor Leslie Dan. It was also featured on the cover of, as well as profiled in, the book "Detail In Process". The Faculty of Pharmacy at the University of Toronto began in 1853, when the Ontario College of Pharmacy (now Pharmacists) who first operated at the school had merged into the school curriculum. By 1868, the pharmacy program consisted of only a few evenings of voluntary classes, with no practically prerequisite classes. However, the long, tradition apprenticeship of this professional field had pressed a strong emphasis onto the students. Today, the program has evolved into "a compulsory, four-year second-entry scientific and professional university course with a supervised period of professional practice." The organization of this program has become significantly more structured. This change in focus strayed away from the predominant emphasis of the practice of training through an apprenticeship to today's emphasis of a theoretical study and application of those skills in real-life situations. Students are better equipped with the skills which are required to meet the present needs of the profession. The University of Toronto was the only school in Ontario to offer a pharmacy education until the opening of the University of Waterloo School of Pharmacy in 2008. In 1877, the Faculty moved into the University of Toronto campus, and new levels of pharmaceutical education was offered as a PhD degree at the University of Toronto was being arranged. As the demands for more pharmacists increased, the demands of professional education in this particular field increased as well. As a result, in 1992, the faculty introduced the PharmD-Doctor of Pharmacy- in hopes to accommodate for the growing need for graduates in the field. Within the past decade, enrolment in the undergraduate and graduate programs and doubled and tripled in size respectively. The Faculty had no choice but to expand their facilities, thus moving to their current location at 144 College Street in 2006. The Faculty of Pharmacy of the University of Toronto's Arms and Badge were registered with the Canadian Heraldic Authority on 17 May 2001. The Latin motto is "Trutina Penso Doctrinae" which means "I weigh by the balance of learning." As the only faculty of pharmacy in Ontario until 2007, the Faculty needed to expand beyond 120 students per year, but could not do so in its limited space. The largest room in the former Pharmacy Building (the Norman F. Hughes building, now the Anthropology Building, located at Huron St. and Russell St.) held only 30 students, and each year (at the time of the proposal) had 120 students. Thus, none of the pharmacy classes could be held within its own building, a serious problem for any professional faculty. As well, the various pharmacy research labs were interspersed throughout the campus. Construction of a new building enabled the pharmacy programme to gradually increase its student intake to 240 new students per year in September 2006, doubling its previous capacity; between 2000 and 2008, the total enrolment in the pharmacy program (all 4 years) increased from 499 to 1,011 students. Other programs administrated by the Faculty, including the graduate-level advanced Pharm.D. program (not to be confused with an entry-level Pharm.D.), the Bachelor of Science specialisation in pharmaceutical chemistry, the M.Sc. and Ph.D. programmes in pharmaceutical sciences and the International Pharmacy Graduates bridging programme also experienced significant growth. On 19 April 2011, the Faculty announced a $1 million donation from Walmart Canada to create the Walmart Canada International Pharmacy Education Centre. This Centre will feature enhanced facilities including a one hundred seat classroom, and will allow increased enrollment into the programme. The $75-million (CAD) building was funded by numerous alumni and organisations, along with the Government of Ontario's SuperBuild fund. The building was named the Leslie L. Dan Faculty of Pharmacy Building in 2001 in honour of the generous donation made by Leslie Dan, an alumnus of the school and a noted pharmacist, philanthropist, entrepreneur and Member of the Order of Canada, as well as founder of the generic drug manufacturer Novopharm and the Canadian Medical Aid Programme. Dan donated $8 million earmarked specifically for the building in 2000, at which point the building was named for him; this was followed up with a $7 million donation to his alma mater in 2002, resulting in the Faculty of Pharmacy being renamed to the Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy. The Leslie Dan Faculty of Pharmacy offers several degrees: The current entry-to-practice PharmD program graduated its first class in 2015, coinciding with the graduation of the last class of traditional post-graduate PharmD students. This change mirrors that of the pharmacy curriculum in the United States of America: introducing advanced pharmacy practice experiences, increasing program admission requirements, thereby reducing and streamlining the didactic portions of the curriculum. This new entry-to-practice PharmD program replaces the previous entry-to-practice Bachelor of Science in Pharmacy (BScPhm) program. Practicing pharmacists holding BScPhm may choose to elect to bridge to the current PharmD degree via the PharmD for Pharmacists program. Graduates from this program will hold both the traditional BScPhm and current PharmD degrees. Since the traditional post-graduate PharmD program is also no longer available, a new post-graduate degree in the form of MScPhm has been established to further the clinical and research skills of practicing pharmacists. At the University of Toronto, pharmacy students are already being trained for physical assessments and prescribing rights through problem-based, experiential and student-directed approaches to common ailments, case-based and critical reasoning skills and other coursework in pathophysiology, clinical biochemistry and pharmaceutical care. These represent important advances in pharmacy education and the pharmacists' new critical role in Canada's health care system, and the use of the new building for Pharmacy is a symbol of the University of Toronto's dedication to health care and pharmaceutical research. In addition, the Faculty offers a non-professional undergraduate Bachelor of Science in Pharmaceutical Science program along with graduate research programs that lead to Master of Science and Doctor of Philosophy (MSc and PhD) degrees in pharmaceutical science.

Telecollaboration is a form of network-based language teaching which emerged in language teaching in the 1990s. It refers to the pedagogic practice of bringing together classes of foreign language learners through computer-mediated communication for the purpose of improving their language skills, intercultural communicative competence and digital literacies. Telecollaboration, also increasingly referred to as online intercultural exchange (OIE), is recognized as a field of computer-assisted language learning as it relates to the use of technology in language learning. Outside the field of language education this type of pedagogic practice is increasingly being used to internationalize the curriculum and offer students the possibility to engage with peers in other parts of the world in collaborative online projects. Different terms are used to refer to this practice, for example virtual exchange, collaborative online international learning (COIL), and globally networked learning. Telecollaboration is based on sociocultural views of learning inspired by Vygotskian theories of learning as a social activity. Guth and Helm (2010) built on the pedagogy of telecollaboration by expanding on its traditional practices via incorporating Web 2.0 tools in online collaborative projects. This enriched practice widely became known as telecollaboration 2.0. Telecollaboration 2.0, being a completely new phase, serves to achieve nearly the same goals of telecollaboration. A distinctive feature of Telecollaboration 2.0, however, lies in prioritizing promoting the development and mastery of new online literacies. Although telecollaboration and telecollaboration 2.0 are used interchangeably, the latter slightly differs in affording "a complex context for language education as it involves the simultaneous use and development" of intercultural competencies, internationalize classrooms and promotes authentic intercultural communication among partnering schools/students. There are several different 'models' of telecollaboration which have been extensively described in the literature. The first models to be developed were based on the partnering of foreign language students with "native speakers" of the target language, usually by organizing exchanges between two classes of foreign language students studying one another's languages. The most well established models are the eTandem and the Cultura, and eTwinning models. eTandem, which developed from the face to face Tandem Learning approach, has been widely adopted by individual learners who seek partners on the many available educational websites which offer to help find partners and suggest activities for tandem partners to engage in. However, the eTandem model has also been used for class-to-class telecollaboration projects where teachers establish specific objectives, tasks, and/or topics for discussion. The Teletandem model is based on eTandem and was developed in Brazil, but focuses on oral communication through VOIP tools such as Skype and Google Hangouts. Until recent years, however, telecollaboration has generally used asynchronous communication tools. The Cultura project was developed by teachers of French as a foreign language at MIT in the late 1990s with the aim of making culture the focus of their foreign language class. This model takes its inspiration from the words of the Russian philosopher Mikhail Bakhtin: "It is only in the eyes of another culture that foreign culture reveals itself fully and profoundly ... A meaning only reveals its depths once it has encountered and come into contact with another foreign meaning" (as cited in Furstenberg, Levet, English, & Maillet, 2001, p. 58). Cultura is based on the notion and process of cultural comparison and entails students analysing cultural products in class with their teachers and interacting with students of the target languages and cultures through which they develop a deeper understanding of each other's culture, attitudes, representations, values, and frames of reference. The eTwinning project, which essentially is a network of schools and educators within the European Union and part of Eramus+, contrasts with its earlier counterparts in not setting specific guidelines apropos of language use, themes or structure. This model serves as a broad platform for schools within the EU to exchange information and share materials online, and provides a virtual space for countless pedagogical opportunities where teachers and students collectively learn, communicate and collaborate using a foreign language. Quintessentially, eTwinning has the following four objectives: 1. setting up a collaborative network among European schools by connecting them via Web 2.0 tools; 2. encouraging educators and students to collaborate with their counterparts in other European countries; 3. fostering a learning environment in which European identity is integrated with multilingualism and multiculturalism; 4. continuously developing educators' professional skills "in the pedagogical and collaborative use of ICT". eTwinning has thus proven to be a strong model for telecollaboration in recent years, since it enables the authentic use of foreign language among virtual partners, i.e. teachers and students. Not surprisingly, eTwinning projects have become increasingly recognized at various educational institutions across the continent. Each of the telecollaborative models discussed above has its strengths and weaknesses: The complexities of the objectives of telecollaboration ("telecollaborative tasks can and should integrate the development of language, intercultural competence, and online literacies") can generate a series of challenges for educators and learners. O’Dowd and Ritter categorized potential reasons for failed communication in telecollaborative projects, sub-dividing them into four levels which, as the researchers indicate, can also overlap and interrelate: O'Dowd and Ritter focus initially on the individual level of possible obstacles to full functionality in telecollaborative projects, specifically the psychobiographical and educational backgrounds of the telecollaborative partners as potential sources for dysfunctional communications, and in particular, on the following two primary aspects: The concept of intercultural communicative competence (ICC) was established by Byram who stated that there are five dimensions (or '5 savoirs') that make an individual interculturally competent: a combination of skills of interpreting, relating, discovery and interaction, of attitudes, knowledge and critical awareness. Learners who embark on a telecollaborative project with immature intercultural communicative competences may struggle to carry out the tasks usefully. Dissonance in terms of motivation, commitment levels and expectations are also potential sources of tension for learning partners. For example, long response times can be interpreted as a lack of interest, or short responses as unfriendliness (Ware). Solid teacher partnerships are essential to the success of telecollaboration and ideally should be constructed before the students embark on the project. According to O'Dowd and Ritter, telecollaboration can be viewed as "a form of virtual team teaching which demands high levels of communication and cooperation with a partner whom they may not have met face to face". Furthermore, since telecollaboration has been devised as a vehicle both for linguistic and intercultural communication, educators as much as students must learn to be 'intercultural speakers' (Byram) and avoid culturally inappropriate behaviors, typecasting, culture clashes and misunderstandings. Teachers will be aware of the curricular needs of their own institution, however these are unlikely to match exactly the requirements of their partner institute. The themes and sequencing of the tasks must, therefore, be the result of a compromise which satisfies the curricular needs of both sides. Reaching compromises necessarily implies that the partners be willing to invest time and energy in the demands of planning, and that they are sensitive to the needs of others. Successful pair and group formation is crucial to successful telecollaboration, however factors such as age, gender or foreign language proficiency can impact projects substantially, leading to the difficult choice between leaving pairings and groupings to chance, or assigning partners according to a rationale, however challenging foreseeing compatibilities and incompatibilities might be. In telecollaborative projects, most of the attention tends to be focused on the online relationships, with the consequent risk of neglecting the local group. The local group is the context within which communication, interaction, negotiation and, thus, a large part of the learning process take place. Consequently these relationships also require teacher guidance and monitoring. A comprehensive preparatory phase is an essential element in effective telecollaborative projects. If teachers can forewarn learners of issues which may arise, they will be better equipped to deal with them and to protect the quality of the exchange. Potentially problematic areas include technical problems, a lack of information about one's partner and his/her environment, as well as partners' expectations not matching. Both the types of available technological tools and access to them can impact the relationship between partners. More sophisticated technological tools on one side can make a less well-equipped telecollaborative partner feel he/she is at a disadvantage. Moreover, restrictions in accessibility can limit opportunities for partners to interact, with repercussions which can include the risk of giving the false impression of disinterest when a learner with limited technological access is less responsive than a partner who has unlimited access. O'Dowd and Ritter include in their list of socio-institutional challenges the organization of the learners' general course of studies, and refer to Belz and Müller-Hartmann's identification of four key areas which can influence the outcome of telecollaborations: These differences can greatly affect the outcome of a project, as they can generate differing expectations regarding the volume of work, the meeting of deadlines, and so forth. O'Dowd and Ritter also indicate the pairing of students whose main focus of academic interest may not be the same as a possible source of dysfunction, in addition to the impact of clashes of institutional policies and philosophies regulating all aspects of the learning and teaching processes. In sociolinguistics, the concept of prestige refers to the regard accorded certain languages or forms of the same language, such as dialects. Since telecollaboration involves intercultural communicative competences as much as purely linguistic skills, O'Dowd and Ritter remind us that telecollaborative interactions can be negatively affected by prestige-based attitudes both to language and culture, which in turn can lead to the ranking of one language and culture over the other, with repercussions on the telecollaborative partnership. At this level, cultural differences relative to communicative behaviors, such as attitudes to small talk, can cause misunderstanding and impact telecollaborations. According to O'Dowd and Ritter these interactional divergences can occur within the following communicative domains: 

A vertical boiler with horizontal fire-tubes is a type of small vertical boiler, used to generate steam for small machinery. It is characterised by having many narrow fire-tubes, running horizontally. Boilers like this have been widely used on ships as either "auxiliary" or "donkey" boilers. Smaller examples, particularly the Robertson type have been used for steam wagons. Parallel tube boilers place all of their fire-tubes in a single parallel group, running from side to side of the boiler shell. The best known of these is the Cochran design. The Cochran boiler was produced by Cochran & Co. of Annan, Scotland. It is widely used in marine practice, either fired directly by coal or oil fuels, or else used for heat recovery from the exhaust of large diesel engines. Where such a boiler may be heated either by the exhaust gases of the main propulsion plant, or else separately fired when in port (usually by oil rather than coal) it is referred to as a "composite boiler". The boiler is a cylindrical vertical water drum with a hemispherical domed top. This domed shape is strong enough not to require staying. The firebox is another hemispherical dome, riveted to the base foundation ring to give a narrow waterspace. The fire-tubes are arranged in a single horizontal group above this, mounted between two flat vertical plates that are inset into the boiler barrel. The first of these plates forms a shallow combustion chamber and is connected to the firebox by a short diagonal neck. The combustion chamber is of the "dry back" form and is closed by a steel and firebrick plate, rather than a water jacket. The exhaust from the fire-tubes is into an external smokebox and a vertical flue. For maintenance access to the tubes, a manhole is provided in the hemispherical dome. A typical Cochran boiler, as illustrated, might be high and in diameter, giving a heating surface of , and a grate area of . Working pressure is between . Where composite firing is used, there are several possible arrangements for the heating gases. Most use a double-pass tube arrangement where another dry back combustion chamber routes the gases from one tube bank to return through the other. Some arrangements use a separate tube bank for the heat recovery exhaust gases or the direct firing gases, others pass the exhaust gases into the top of the (unlit) firebox. A pure heat-recovery boiler may have no firebox at all, other than a shallow domed plate for strength. Cochran also offer a modified "Sinuflo" fire-tube, which is claimed to offer better heat transfer from the gases. This is bent into a number of horizontal sinusoidal waves, rather than being straight. The Cochran boiler was not applied to locomotives, but was used for a pair of experimental steam railmotors built for the GNSR by Andrew Barclay in 1905. These were not successful and were scrapped after a few years, although one coach body survives in a poor state. The Clarke Chapman boiler is similar to the Cochran type, with the difference that the top of the boiler shell is a shallow dome rather than a hemisphere. This dome shape is still sufficiently strong to withstand the pressure, but there is now a sharp corner between the shell and the top plate. This corner requires the support of gusset stays. Clarke Chapman boilers are made in both 'dry back' (as for the Cochran) and 'wet back' forms. The wet back or "Victoria" (illustrated) has the combustion chamber entirely surrounded by water. This increases the heating surface and reduces lost heat, but it also makes the boiler more complex to manufacture and makes tube cleaning more difficult. Radial horizontal tube boilers avoid the flat tubeplate of the Cochran boiler in favour of a circular firebox, a shape that better resists pressure. They thus have their tubes arranged radially, so as to seat more easily by entering the firebox perpendicular to the plate. The design by Robertson of Fleetwood, Lancashire, was originally used in steam wagons. It was often used in similar situations to the Sentinel boiler, but has fire-tubes rather than watertubes. It is best known from its popularity in model engineering, as a multi-tube boiler that's relatively easy to construct. The boiler consists of two concentric drums with a waterspace between them. Fire-tubes pass through this drum, arranged symmetrically around the diameter. The entire boiler is wrapped in a cylindrical smokebox. The top of the inner drum is not water-jacketed and is only closed by a steel plate. The outer drum is a parallel cylinder but the inner drum is usually stepped in three diameters: wide around the fire grate to provide the most grate area and to promote rapid boiling in its waterjacket, the central section carries the inner ends of the fire-tubes, and the upper section is narrowed to reduce the unjacketed surface area and to provide an open steam space above the waterline. This upper space is deliberately oversized so that when fitted to a road vehicle, any tilting during hill climbing will still leave an adequate depth of water cover above the tubes. The top plate is unjacketed so that it may contain a hatch and a firing chute. Where the boiler is used for steam wagons it is often coke-fired with a deep firebed, and coke is merely poured down this chute rather than carefully distributed. This means of firing is acceptable with coke, but with coal would lead to a thick, dull fire that blocked with clinker. It is also less distracting when trying to drive a steam vehicle. Avoiding coal also reduces the risk of volatile gases flaring out of the firing chute when it is opened. The boiler is sometimes superheated by a semi-radiant element arranged as a coil inside the upper part of the central drum. The Blake boiler has features of both the Clarke Chapman and the Robertson designs. The combustion chamber is set entirely within the water space so that all of it can provide heating surface, and it is made cylindrical for strength. The tubes are arranged radially rather than in a parallel group, so as to enter the combustion chamber perpendicularly. This makes expanding their ends a simpler operation and gives better sealing. The smokebox is larger and partially wraps around the outside of the boiler drum. The Harris "Economic" boiler is a design for a model engineering-sized boiler. Similar to the Blake, but symmetrical with a centrally placed combustion chamber and fire-tubes around the entire circumference. Similar boilers, both fire-tube to 'Meredith's Patent' and water-tube boilers of their own design, were also produced by Riley Brothers of Stockton-on-Tees from around 1890 to WWI. 

Sanayi is an at-grade station on the Fahrettin Altay—Evka 3 Line of the İzmir Metro in Bornova. It is located in the Kazımdirik neighborhood adjacent to Üniversite Avenue. The area around Sanayi station consists of mostly warehouses with a few apartment buildings. The station opened on 22 May 2000 as part of the ten original stations on the İzmir Metro. Sanayi was originally a railway station on the Bornova suburban line known as 2. Sanayi railway station (). The station was built by the Smyrna Cassaba Railway (SCP) and opened on 25 October 1866. Trains from Basmane station to Bornova stopped at Sanayi. Since the Bornova Branch was never extended, the station and the line remained a suburban railway. The Turkish State Railways (TCDD) took over the SCP in 1934 and continued operating commuter service on the railway. TCDD sold the railway to the İzmir Municipality in 1994 and Sanayi, along with the railway, was closed down. The Municipality began construction of the İzmir Metro in 1995 and Sanayi station was demolished. The new station was built on the existing right-of-way shortly after. Construction was completed in 1999 and the station was inaugurated on 22 May 2000, along with the metro line from Bornova to Üçyol. ESHOT operates city bus service on Üniversite Avenue.

The Lwów Oath () was an oath made on April 1, 1656 by Polish king John II Casimir in Latin cathedral in the city of Lwów (today Lviv, western Ukraine). During "the Deluge", when the Swedish armies invaded Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth, which was already struggling with Muscovy, the Voivode of Poznań, Krzysztof Opaliński, surrendered Greater Poland to Swedish king Charles Gustav. Other areas also surrendered in rapid succession. Almost the whole country followed suit, with the Swedes entering Warsaw unopposed in August 1655 and John Casimir fleeing to Silesia, where he took refuge in the town of Oberglogau () staying there in a local castle from October 17, 1655 until December 18 of the same year. However several places still resisted, most remarkably (and symbolically) the monastery at Jasna Góra (November 1655 to January 1656). The defense of Jasna Góra galvanized Polish resistance against the Swedes, as aggression on that place, perceived by Catholic Poles as the most holy sanctuary, rose massive anti-Swedish sentiments. In December 1655 the Tyszowce Confederation formed in support of the exiled John Casimir. Spontaneous uprisings started all over the country, attacking the dispersed occupation forces — who, in their turn, retaliated. The uprisings soon merged under the leadership of Polish military leaders Stefan Czarniecki and Grand Hetman of Lithuania Paweł Jan Sapieha, who started organized counterattacks in order to eliminate those loyal to Charles Gustav. Considering these facts, John II Casimir decided to return. Trying to pass Swedish troops unexposed, he rode with only small host, from Silesia through Carpathian Mountains, finally reaching Lwów in March 1656. As almost the whole country was occupied by the Swedish or Russian armies, the reason behind the vow was to incite the whole nation, including peasantry in the first place, to rise up against the invaders. Thus two main issues raised by the king in the vows were primarily - a necessity to protect the Catholic faith, seen as endangered by the Lutheran (and to some point Orthodox) aggressors, secondly - to manifest the will to improve the peasantry's condition. On 1 April 1656, during a holy mass in Lwów's Cathedral, conducted by the papal legate Pietro Vidoni, John Casimir in a grandiose and elaborate ceremony entrusted the Commonwealth under the Blessed Virgin Mary's protection, whom he announced as "The Queen of the Polish Crown and other of his countries". He also swore to "protect the Kingdom's folk from any impositions and unjust bondage". Today, the Blessed Virgin Mary is known as the Queen of Poland. After the King, similar vow was taken by the Deputy Chancellor of the Crown and the bishop of Kraków Andrzej Trzebicki in the name of the szlachta noblemen of the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth forces finally drove back the Swedes in 1657 and the Russians in 1661. After the war, promises made by John Casimir in Lwów, especially those considering peasants' lot, were not fulfilled, mostly because of Sejm's objection, which represented the szlachta nobility, not attracted to the idea of reducing serfdom, which would negatively affect their economical interests. Since the Lwów Oath Holy Virgin Mary is commonly believed to save Poland miraculously during the Deluge, Battle of Vienna, Partitions of Poland, Polish-Soviet War, World War II and the Polish People's Republic. 

The North polar sequence is a group of 96 stars that was used to define stellar magnitudes and colors. The cluster of stars lies within two degrees of the Northern Celestial pole. That fact makes them visible to everyone in the northern hemisphere. Originally proposed by Edward Charles Pickering, the system was used between 1900 and 1950. Today it has been replaced by the UBV photometric system.

Hollick is a surname. Notable people with the surname include: 

Starting in the 12th century, the Margraviate, later Electorate, of Brandenburg was in conflict with the neighboring Duchy of Pomerania over frontier territories claimed by them both, and over the status of the Pomeranian duchy, which Brandenburg claimed as a fief, whereas Pomerania claimed Imperial immediacy. The conflict frequently turned into open war, and despite occasional success, none of the parties prevailed permanently until the House of Pomerania died out in 1637. Brandenburg would by then have naturally have prevailed, but this was hindered by the contemporary Swedish occupation of Pomerania, and the conflict continued between Sweden and Brandenburg-Prussia until 1815, when Prussia incorporated Swedish Pomerania into her Province of Pomerania. In the 10th century, the area of the future Brandenburg and Pomerania was inhabited by West Slavic tribes, collectively known as Wends. Roughly, the tribes east of the Oder and north of the Warta (Warthe) rivers constituted the Pomeranians and the tribes west of the Oder the Luticians. The classification is uncertain for the tribes living close to the lower Oder, that is the Velunzani on the islands in the Oder estuary, the Prissani on the eastern bank of the lower Oder, and the Ukrani and Recani on the western bank of the lower Oder, which became known as the Uckermark. The tribes west of the Oder were organized in marches of the Ottonian (Liudolfing) realm, which became the Holy Roman Empire with the coronation of Otto I, Holy Roman Emperor in 962. The marches set up in the area of the future Brandenburg and Pomerania were the Billung March in the north, and the Saxon Eastern March in the south; the boundary was the Peene river. The Saxon Eastern March was soon partitioned, with the area of future northern Brandenburg and southwestern Pomerania re-organized in the Northern March. A rebellion of the Liuticians overthrew the margraves' rule in most of the Northern and Billung marches between 983 and 995. In the 11th century, the Liutician confederation collapsed due to internal struggles, leaving its territory vulnerable to its neighbors' campaigns, including expeditions of the margraves of the Northern March. Wartislaw I, Duke of Pomerania and first verified member of the House of Pomerania, conquered the Peene and Tollense areas west of the lower Oder from the Luticians during the 1120s. Albert (Albrecht) the Bear, invested with the March of Lusatia in 1123, was ready to succeed deceased Henry, Count of Stade as margrave of the Northern March in 1128, and was invested with the march by Holy Roman Emperor Lothair of Supplinburg in 1134, after he had already secured his succession of Pribislaw of the Hevelli in 1129. In 1128, Albert participated in the organization of the mission of Otto of Bamberg in the Lutician areas held by Wartislaw I of Pomerania, and supplied him with an escort. When in 1136 Emperor Lothair gave lands in the Peene area to Otto's bishopric of Bamberg, Albert was asked to approve first. Focused on the Northern March, Albert renounced his post as the margrave of Lusatia in 1136, which was then fused into the March of Meißen and became the basis of the state of the House of Wettin. In 1138, Conrad III of Germany also invested Albert the Bear with the Duchy of Saxony, but Albert resigned in 1142 due to the opposition of the Saxon nobility, who had favoured and eventually installed then minor Henry the Lion as their duke. In 1147, Albert participated in the Wendish Crusade to the Pomeranian strongholds of Demmin and Stettin, which however did not result in the acquisition of territories — the size of the Northern March actually controlled by Albert differed significantly from what Emperor Lothair had originally promised. Instead, as a result of the crusade, several Saxon nobles had established petty realms in the march, and the Pomeranians still held vast areas south of the Peene river as well as the Uckermark. Albert however succeeded Pribislaw in the Hevellian territories in 1150, and when he defeated Jaxa of Köpenick and incorporated the latter's territory into his march in 1157, the term Margraviate of Brandenburg replaced the designation Northern March. Albert upheld his claims to Western Pomerania, and campaigned in the Pomeranian-held Uckermark since 1157. Albert the Bear's successor in Saxony, Henry the Lion, had by then established himself as one of the most powerful nobles in Germany. In pursuit of his own interests in the Wendish territories and with Danish support, Henry defeated his rebellious Obodrite subjects and their Pomeranian allies in the Battle of Verchen near the Pomeranian stronghold of Demmin in 1164. As a consequence, the Pomeranian dukes became Henry's vassals, and supported Henry in subsequent campaigns against the margraves of Brandenburg. However, Henry finally lost the struggle he was engaged in with Holy Roman Emperor Barbarossa, and in 1180 was deprived of his ducal titles. The Pomeranian duke then pledged allegiance to Barbarossa in 1181, thwarting Ascanian ambitions. Constant Danish military pressure resulted in Danish vassalage of Pomerania in 1184/85. The Ascanian margraves launched several expeditions into Danish Pomerania between 1198 and 1199, and between 1211 and 1214. Despite a temporary sack of Stettin in 1214 and more permanent territorial gains in the Finow area, they were unable to establish themselves in Pomerania, and Danish superiority even led Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor to renounce all German claims to the area in favour of Denmark in 1214. By then, the margraves restricted themselves to guard the contemporary Brandenburg-Pomeranian frontier by erecting the Oderberg fortress ""contra Sclavos"" in 1214. Only after the utter defeat of the Danish forces in the Battle of Bornhöved in 1227, was the area reclaimed by the empire. The Brandenburgian margraves then re-enforced their claims on Pomerania, and were invested with the duchy by Frederick II in 1231 in Ravenna. In the 1230s, the Margraviate of Brandenburg was ruled in common by two brothers of the House of Ascania, John I and Otto III, while the Duchy of Pomerania was partially divided and ruled by two cousins of the House of Pomerania, Wartislaw III of Pomerania-Demmin and Barnim I of Pomerania-Stettin. Johann I of Brandenburg married a daughter of Valdemar Sejr, king of Denmark, and therewith came into possession of half of the terra Wolgast in Pomerania. He then forced Wartislaw III into the Treaty of Kremmen in 1236: Wartislaw III had to recognize Brandenburgian overlordship and succession in Pomerania-Demmin, and cede his territories south of Demmin to Brandenburg. Also in the 1230s, Barnim I had sold the southern Uckermark between Templin and Angermünde to the margraves, and renounced his claims on the Barnim and Teltow areas. In the subsequent Treaty of Landin (Hohenlandin) in 1250, Barnim I formally accepted Brandenburgian overlordship and ceded the northern Uckermark to Brandenburg, but in turn received Johann's part of Wolgast and managed to rescind the succession clause of Kremmen. Barnim I had to make further territorial concessions when Brandenburg established her Neumark ("New March") along the Warthe (Warta) river in the second half of the 13th century, and in 1267 married Mechthild, daughter of Otto III of Brandenburg. Barnim I had inherited Pomerania-Demmin after Wartislaw III died without issue in 1264, but the duchy was again internally divided in 1295 - this time into a northern part, Pomerania-Wolgast, and a southern part, Pomerania-Stettin. In 1302, Otto I of Pomerania-Stettin, grandson of Brandenburgian margrave Otto III, made peace with Brandenburg. Tensions with Pomerania-Wolgast eased when Waldemar became the Brandenburgian margrave in 1309, and Brandenburg pawned Schlawe-Stolp to Pomerania in the Treaty of Templin, concluded in 1317. With Waldemar's death without issue, the House of Ascania died out. The House of Wittelsbach (also House of Bavaria) did not immediately succeed the House of Ascania as margraves of Brandenburg: Since the electors of the Holy Roman Emperor disagreed in 1314, a war ensued between the two candidates Louis of Wittelsbach and Frederick of Habsburg that lasted until 1322, when Louis prevailed in the Battle of Mühldorf. Thus, the death of Ascanian margrave Waldemar was not followed by a proper investiture of another noble with the Margraviate of Brandenburg due to the lack of an established emperor. The closest relative of deceased Waldemar was his ten-year-old cousin Henry, who is unlikely to have had valid claims on the margraviate. Henry was the son of Waldermar's uncle Henry of Landsberg, a distant relative of both Wartislaw IV, Duke of Pomerania-Wolgast and Rudolf I, Duke of Saxe-Wittenberg from another line of the House of Ascania, who was married to a daughter of former Ascanian margrave Otto V. Wartislaw IV quickly advanced into eastern Brandenburg, took the boy into custody, had the local nobility formally declare him Henry's custodian, and acted as the de facto ruler of the margraviate. Rudolf I on the other hand declared himself custodian of Waldemar's widow and temporarily took over her possessions in western and central Brandenburg (Havelland, Teltow and Barnim). Rudolf I's plans were thwarted when Waldemar's widow married Otto of Brunswick in late 1319. Yet, he continued his occupation of Brandenburgian territories and by 1320 controlled Havelland, Teltow, Barnim, Zauche and Lower Lusatia. Like Wartislaw IV, Rudolf I tried to take young Henry into custody, and probably managed to do so in early 1320. Henry died in the summer of 1320. In anticipation of a possible take-over of Brandenburg by a rival who then could claim Pomerania as a Brandenburgian fief, the Pomeranian dukes took their duchy as a fief from the bishops of Cammin the same year. Meanwhile, other neighbors of Brandenburg also annexed frontier areas of the seemingly vacated margraviate - Silesia took the Görlitz area, Bohemia the Bautzen area, and Mecklenburgian forces occupied the Prignitz and advanced into the Uckermark. Pomeranian forces had also advanced into the Uckermark, halted the Mecklenburgian campaign and occupied the Prenzlau and Pasewalk areas. In addition, the Pomeranian dukes as well as Rudolf I of Saxe-Wittenberg claimed the Lebus area. After Louis of the House of Wittelsbach, later crowned Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor, had decided the war against the House of Habsburg in his favour in September 1322, he gave the Margraviate of Brandenburg to his seven-year-old son, Louis V "the Brandenburger" in 1323. The formal investiture was issued in 1324, and included the Duchy of Pomerania as a Brandenburgian fief. Rudolf I in late 1324 withdrew from Brandenburgian areas in turn for a compensation, The House of Wittelsbach subsequently gained control over the margraviate until they were in full charge in 1343. During this process, the Pomeranians had to withdraw from the Uckermark after a series of battles throughout the late 1320s and early 1330s. In 1330, they took their duchy as a papal fief to circumvent Brandenburg's claims. In 1338, they concluded a peace with Brandenburg, who renounced her claims on overlordship but maintained the right of succession. In 1348 the conman "Falscher Waldemar" pretended to be Waldemar, Margrave of Brandenburg, claiming he had been declared dead erroneously while on a pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Probably a strawman of Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor of the House of Luxembourg, and/or the Anhaltine and Saxon branches of the House of Ascania, he was invested with the margraviate between 1148 and 1150, and took on his position as a margrave with military support of Charles IV and the Ascanians. The House of Wittelsbach was expelled from most of Brandenburg and only controlled the Neumark and some adjacent areas. Together with Denmark, the Pomeranian dukes sided with the Wittelsbachs, and the alliance had already gained ground in 1350 when Charles IV re-invested the House of Wittelsbach with Brandenburg. Louis VI the Roman, margrave between 1351 and 1365, had to re-establish his rule against the opposition of the Ascanians, which he accomplished by 1355. During this process, the Brandenburg-Pomeranian border in the Uckermark was settled in 1354. When war broke out again in the beginning of the 1370s between the Pomeranian dukes and Louis VI' successor Otto V "the lazy", Pomerania was allied to Charles IV: Following a policy of territorial expansion and economical consolidation of his Kingdom of Bohemia, Charles IV of the House of Luxembourg had already before Louis IV the Roman's death in 1365 concluded a treaty with both Louis IV and his brother, Otto V, for succession of Charles IV's son Wenzel (Wenceslaus) IV in Brandenburg. Furthermore, Otto V had laid Brandenburg's administration in Charles IV's hands for six years in 1365. In 1373, Charles IV forced Otto V to sign the Treaty of Fürstenwalde: Otto V renounced his claims to Brandenburg (since the Golden Bull of 1356 an electorate) in favour of the House of Luxembourg in return for a compensation with 300,000 gulden, paid by pawning to him parts of New Bohemia (Charles IV's designation for his gains in the Upper Palatinate). The Pomeranian dukes were on good terms with Charles IV, who gained the Electorate of Brandenburg for his House of Luxembourg "de facto" from 1365 to 1371, and "de jure" in 1373. Charles IV had granted the House of Pomerania their Duchy of Pomerania as an imperial fief, and border disputes were settled or suspended. Charles IV's heirs did not continue his policy of territorial integration and economical consolidation in Brandenburg: instead, the electorate faced internal partitions and economical decay. The Pomeranian dukes discontinued the formerly good relations with the Luxembourgians and successfully campaigned in the Uckermark on their own initiative or as allies of Brandenburg's opponents, shifting the border with Brandenburg southwards beyond Prenzlau. In 1411, the Luxembourgians resigned from the electorate, and transferred their title to Frederick IV, Burgrave of Nuremberg of the House of Hohenzollern (also House of Zollern), who started his reign in Brandenburg as Frederick I. When Frederick I of the House of Hohenzollern took over the Electorate of Brandenburg in 1411, he and his successors restricted the influence of the local nobles, towns and clergy, and followed a policy of territorial expansion. Since the eastern frontier with Pomerania, the Neumark, was pawned to the Teutonic Order state from 1402 to 1455, the western frontier (Uckermark) was in the focus of the Brandenburg–Pomeranian conflict: The first major battle between the Pomeranian and Hohenzollern armies took place in 1412 at Kremmer Damm, only one year after Frederick I had taken over the electorate. The Duchy of Pomerania was at that time internally divided into petty realms, each such Teilherzogtum was ruled by a distinct member of the House of Pomerania. The first series of wars was primarily fought between Frederick I and the dukes of Pomerania-Stettin, allied to the powerful Brandenburgian noble family von Quitzow, and resulted in some Brandenburgian gains, the expulsion of the von Quiltzows, the imperial ban of the dukes and towns of Pomerania-Stettin, and finally a temporary peace between Brandenburg and Pomerania concluded in Eberswalde in 1415. The Pomeranian dukes allied with the dukes of Mecklenburg in 1418 and renewed their attacks, but were decisively defeated by Brandenburgian forces in the streets of Angermünde in 1420 and had to hand over the Uckermark in the subsequent Treaty of Perleberg. In 1425, the anti-Brandenburgian alliance launched a more successful campaign, after which the Uckermark was divided between Brandenburg and Pomerania in a second treaty of Eberswalde in 1427. In 1444, war about the border in the Uckermark broke out anew. After four years of fighting, Brandenburg and Pomerania in the Peace of Prenzlau (1448) settled for a division of the Uckermark that only slightly differed from the division of 1427. In 1459, Brandenburg gained a few strongholds in the Uckermark for aiding several Pomeranian dukes in an internal struggle with their relative Eric II. With the death of Otto III of Pomerania-Stettin in 1464, a series of wars was fought for Otto III's succession, claimed by both the House of Pomerania and the House of Hohenzollern. The battlefields were the Pomerania-Stettin, Uckermark and Neumark areas, and the war was halted only for short periods by the Treaty of Soldin (1466) and Treaty of Prenzlau (1472). The Treaty of Prenzlau (1479) finally ended the war, largely confirming the terms of the previous treaties: Pomerania-Stettin remained under the rule of the House of Pomerania, who in turn became vassals of the electors of Brandenburg. The Peace of Prenzlau was followed by a series of negotiations, which led to the conclusion of the preliminary Treaty of Pyritz in 1493, and the final Treaty of Grimnitz in 1529: The Duchy of Pomerania became an imperial immediate fief, but the members of the House of Pomerania had to receive it in the presence of Brandenburgian representatives, and Brandenburg was granted the right of succession in the Pomeranian duchy in case the House of Pomerania became extinct. Seven years before the last duke of the House of Pomerania died, which would have led to Brandenburgian succession in the Duchy of Pomerania, Swedish forces had occupied Pomerania in the course of the Thirty Years' War. By the death of Bogislaw XIV, Duke of Pomerania in 1637, Sweden refused to hand over the duchy to Brandenburg. When the war ended, Sweden and Brandenburg agreed in the Peace of Westphalia (1648) and the subsequent Treaty of Stettin (1653) to partition Pomerania by a divide just east of the Oder: Western Pomerania became Swedish Pomerania, while Farther Pomerania became Brandenburgian Pomerania. Brandenburg, later Brandenburg-Prussia, gained Swedish Pomerania step by step in the following centuries: most of the Swedish strip east of the Oder in the Peace of Saint-Germain-en-Laye that ended the Scanian War in 1679, Swedish Pomerania south of the Peene and east of the Peenestrom rivers with Stettin in the Treaty of Frederiksborg and Treaty of Stockholm that ended the Great Northern War in 1720, and the remainder with Rügen, Stralsund and Greifswald in the Congress of Vienna that ended the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. The former Swedish part was then merged with the former Brandenburgian part and to become the Prussian Province of Pomerania. 

Cogglesford Mill (sometimes referred to as Coggesford) is a Grade II listed working watermill in Sleaford, Lincolnshire. It is possibly the last working Sheriff's Mill in England. The mill sits to the north of Sleaford on banks of River Slea. There is archaeological evidence of a Saxon mill on the site and records in the Domesday book of later mills; the present redbrick structure dates to the late 18th century, with alterations from the 19th Century. The ford from which the mill takes its name is where the Roman road now called Mareham Lane crossed the Slea. The original crossing, no longer extant, is a few hundred yards downstream of the mill, close to the current footbridge. There were many other mills along the river at various times. During the construction of the Sleaford Navigation, in the 1790s, locks were provided at each of the mills to maintain the necessary head. After the navigation closed and as the locks fell into repair they were replaced by weirs, and the weir at Cogglesford is particularly elaborate, having to maintain the head of this still working mill. Cogglesford mill (including the mill race and bridge) was assigned a listed status on 20 July 1973. The mill is open to the public 7 days a week during the summer and Organic stoneground flour is milled there and sold in shop. 

The X Army Corps / X AK () was a corps level command of the Prussian and German Armies before and during World War I. X Corps was one of three formed in the aftermath of the Austro-Prussian War (the others being IX Corps and XI Corps). The Corps was formed in October 1866 with headquarters in Hannover. The catchment area included the newly annexed Kingdom of Hanover (thereafter the Province of Hanover), the Grand Duchy of Oldenburg and the Duchy of Brunswick. During the Franco-Prussian War it was assigned to the 2nd Army. In peacetime, it was assigned to the III Army Inspectorate. which became the 2nd Army at the start of the First World War. It was still in existence at the end of the war in "Armee-Abteilung" B, "Heeresgruppe Herzog Albrecht von Württemberg" at the extreme southern end of the Western Front. The Corps was disbanded with the demobilisation of the German Army after World War I. During the Franco-Prussian War of 1870–71 the army corps fought under the command of General von Voigts-Rhetz in several battles including the Battle of Mars-la-Tour, Battle of Spicheren, Siege of Metz, Battle of Beaune-la-Rolande, Battle of Orléans and Battle of Le Mans. Due to the large number of Line Infantry regiments then in existence, on 18 December 1890, Kaiser Wilhelm II ordered that the flag colours were to be the same as that of the uniform epaulettes. This was to ensure that each corps attained uniformity. IX and X Corps wore white epaulettes. Notwithstanding this, the flags of the Jäger Battalions would be green. The 25 peacetime Corps of the German Army (Guards, I - XXI, I - III Bavarian) had a reasonably standardised organisation. Each consisted of two divisions with usually two infantry brigades, one field artillery brigade and a cavalry brigade each. Each brigade normally consisted of two regiments of the appropriate type, so each Corps normally commanded 8 infantry, 4 field artillery and 4 cavalry regiments. There were exceptions to this rule: Each Corps also directly controlled a number of other units. This could include one or more On mobilization on 2 August 1914 the Corps was restructured. 19th Cavalry Brigade was withdrawn to form part of the 9th Cavalry Division and the 20th Cavalry Brigade was broken up. The 17th (Brunswick) Hussars was raised to a strength of 6 squadrons before being split into two half-regiments of 3 squadrons each; the half-regiments were assigned as divisional cavalry to 19th and 20th Divisions. Likewise, the 16th (2nd Hannover) Dragoons formed two half-regiments which were assigned as divisional cavalry to 17th and 18th Divisions of IX Corps. Divisions received engineer companies and other support units from the Corps headquarters. In summary, X Corps mobilised with 25 infantry battalions, 9 machine gun companies (54 machine guns), 6 cavalry squadrons, 24 field artillery batteries (144 guns), 4 heavy artillery batteries (16 guns), 3 pioneer companies and an aviation detachment. On mobilisation, X Corps was assigned to the 2nd Army forming part of the right wing of the forces for the Schlieffen Plan offensive in August 1914 on the Western Front. It was still in existence at the end of the war in "Armee-Abteilung" B, "Heeresgruppe Herzog Albrecht von Württemberg" at the extreme southern end of the Western Front. The X Corps had the following commanders during its existence:

Hans Skramstad (26 December 1797 – 15 June 1839) was a Norwegian pianist and composer. 

Waris Ali Shah (1817-1905) was a Sufi saint from Dewa, Barabanki, India, and the founder of the Warsi Sufi order. He travelled widely in the west and admitted people to his spiritual order. His shrine is at Dewa, India. His father was Qurban Ali Shah, whose tomb is in Dewa. At an early age Shah showed an inclination for a religious life. He went to Mecca for pilgrimage many times. During his travels in Europe, he visited the Sultan of Turkey and Otto von Bismarck in Berlin. He also travelled to England and had an audience with Queen Victoria. He was a friend of Abdul Bari. He died on 5 April 1905 (29 Muharram 1323 AH). Waris Ali Shah belonged to the Qadiriyya and Chishtiyya schools of Sufism. He had a liberal view and permitted his followers to stay in their own religions. As a boy, Shah attached himself to Khadim Ali Shah, a Dervish of Golaganj, Lucknow, in the state of Uttar Pradesh, India, and remained with the latter until his death in 1832-33 when Shah was 16 years old. He had followers from several faiths. Shah’s father's death anniversary, locally known as Dewa Mela is observed in October–November and is attended by nearly a million Muslims and Hindus. Shah reportedly started this event in memory of his own father, Qurban Ali Shah. Another annual fair is held on Shah’s tomb in 1 Safar.. 

Caitlin Jade Foord (born 11 November 1994) is an Australian professional soccer player who plays as a forward for FA Women's Super League club Arsenal. She became the youngest Australian to play at a World Cup when she represented Australia at the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup at the age of 16. Foord was signed by the Central Coast Mariners ahead of the 2009 W-League season from the New South Wales Institute of Sport. With the announcement that the Central Coast Mariners would not field a women's team in the 2010–11 W-League season, Foord, along with fellow Mariners players Teresa Polias, Lydia Vandenbergh, and Renee Rollason, all switched to nearby club, Sydney FC. Foord spent four straight seasons with Sydney FC, she appeared in 44 games and scored 10 goals. In March 2013, it was announced that Foord had signed with American team, Sky Blue FC, for the inaugural season of the NWSL. In 2013 she appeared in 15 games, helping Sky Blue to their only playoff appearance in club history. She was named to the 2013 NWSL Second XI. Foord returned to Sky Blue for the 2014 NWSL Season, she was in the starting lineup for 20 out of her 21 appearances. Sky Blue finished the season in sixth place. In February 2015 Foord agreed to return to Sky Blue alongside alongside fellow Matildas teammate Samantha Kerr. Due to the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup, they would not join the team until July. She appeared in the final 10 games of the 2015 NWSL season for Sky Blue. After being listed on Sky Blue's preseason roster for the 2016 NWSL Season, Foord did not participate in preseason training and did not play for Sky Blue during the 2016 season. In December 2016 it was reported that Foord would not play in the NWSL in 2017 either as she was signing with a team in Japan. In August 2014, it was announced that Foord had signed a one-year deal to join Perth Glory for the 2014 W-League season. In 12 appearances for Perth, Foord scored 5 goals. Foord re-signed with Perth of the 2015-16 W-League season. On 2 January 2016 Foord suffered a broken collar bone that required surgery. This injury ruled her out for the remainder of the season. On 13 September 2016, Sydney FC announced that Foord had signed with the club. She would be returning to the club where she had previously played for four seasons. In 10 matches for Sydney during the 2016-17 W-League season, she played 766 minutes and scored 2 goals. In January 2017, Japan Women's Football League club Vegalta Sendai Ladies announced that the club had signed Foord on a one-year deal. On 15 December 2017, after her season had concluded in Japan, Foord returned to Sydney FC and re-signed for the 2017-18 W-League season. Foord scored 3 goals in 6 games and helped Sydney FC qualify for the playoffs. In the semi-final match against the Newcastle Jets Foord suffered a ruptured Lisfranc ligament which would require surgery. This injury would force her to miss the 2018 Grand Final against Melbourne City. Melbourne won the game 2–0. In the 2018-19 W-League season, Foord scored her second career W-League hat-trick on 9 December 2018 against the Brisbane Roar. Her three goals helped Sydney to a 5–1 victory, ending their three-game losing streak. Foord briefly returned to Sydney for the 2019-20 W-League season, scoring 2 goals in 9 appearances before leaving early to pursue an opportunity with Arsenal in January 2020. On 11 January 2018, Foord's rights in the NWSL were traded from Sky Blue to Seattle Reign FC for Katie Johnson and Rebekah Stott. Her rights were subsequently traded to the Portland Thorns FC along with a 2020 NWSL 2nd Round draft pick in exchange for US international midfielder Allie Long. However, Foord was still playing in the W-League at the time and suffered a serious foot injury in the semi-final that required surgery. As a result she didn't make her debut for the Thorns until 6 August 2018. On 14 April 2019, Foord scored her first goal for Portland, in a 2–0 win over Orlando Pride. On 8 January 2020, Foord's NWSL rights were traded to Orlando Pride along with Emily Sonnett and two draft picks in exchange for Orlando's No. 1 overall selection in the 2020 NWSL College Draft. On 24 January 2020, Foord left Sydney FC to sign for FA WSL club Arsenal, becoming the fifth Australian to move to the league during the 2019–20 season. She made her debut for the club on 23 February 2020, scoring in a 2–0 FA Cup victory over second division club Lewes. The following week, Foord made her second appearance, this time playing the full 90 minutes as Arsenal lost the 2020 FA Women's League Cup Final against Chelsea. As part of the Australian Westfield U16 Women's team, Foord helped the team to progress through to the AFC U17 Women's Championship undefeated by scoring a hat-trick in a match against the Philippines. Foord made her debut for the Matildas on 12 May 2011 in a friendly against New Zealand in Gosford. She scored a goal in her debut, as Australia won the match 3–0. At the age of 16, Foord was named to the Matildas squad for the 2011 FIFA Women's World Cup in Germany. Foord started in two of the three group matches as a right back. She then started in the midfield for Australia's quarter-final match against Sweden. She returned to the full-back position after Elyse Perry was substituted for Tameka Butt in the 59th minute. The Matildas were eliminated from the competition after losing the match 3–1. Foord was given the "Best Young Player" award for the tournament. As a result of her play at the 2011 Women's World Cup, Foord was named AFC Youth Player of the year for 2011. Foord was named to the Australian roster for the 2014 AFC Women's Asian Cup. She appeared in all 5 matches for Australia and scored a goal in their 2–2 draw against Japan in the group stage. Australia lost 1–0 to Japan in the final, but had already clinched a qualifying spot at the 2015 FIFA Women's World Cup. In 2015 Foord was named to her second World Cup squad, this time as a forward. At the 2015 World Cup, Foord played every minute of Australia's five matches, as the Matildas were eliminated in the quarter-finals by AFC rival, Japan. Foord competed in her first Olympics in 2016. She scored a goal in Australia's 2–2 draw against Germany in the group stage. Australia was eliminated in the quarter-finals by Brazil on penalties. In December 2016, Foord was named AFC Player of the year, becoming only the second player to win youth and senior player of the year awards. At the 2017 Tournament of Nations Foord scored two goals against Brazil, en route to a 6–1 Australian victory. Australian won the inaugural edition of the tournament. Due to the foot injury she suffered in February 2018 during the W-League semi-final, Foord would miss the 2018 Algarve Cup and the 2018 AFC Women's Asian Cup. She made her return to the Matildas line-up at the 2018 Tournament of Nations, where she made three substitute appearances. Foord scored her first international hat-trick in a friendly game against Chile on 13 November 2018, Australia won the match 5–0. In May 2019, Foord was named to her third World Cup Team. At the World Cup, Foord played in all four of Australia's matches. She scored a goal in the group stage against Brazil helping Australia overcome a 0–2 deficit to win 3–2. Australia was eliminated by Norway in the Round of 16. In 2013, Foord was featured in an hour-long episode of ESPN's "Aussies Abroad" entitled, "The Matildas", which profiled four Australian national team players (Foord, Lisa De Vanna, Kyah Simon, and Samantha Kerr) and their experience playing internationally. Foord has also starred in the Back Of The Net movie. Foord, Lindsey Horan, and Emily Sonnett (her former Portland Thorns FC teammates) have matching tattoos. 

Éric Salignon (born 22 July 1982 in Carpentras) is a French racing driver. A former two-time winner of the Monaco Kart Cup, Salignon moved into Formula Renault in 2000, competing in both the European and French championships. Solid campaigns in both championships enabled Salignon to finished 16th in his national championship, and one place lower in the pan-European series. He continued in both series in 2001, driving for Graff Racing. He finished fifth in the Eurocup, in just seven races. With his focus on the French series, he won that particular championship by 37 points. This performance earned him a spot in the inaugural Renault Driver Development programme in 2002. Salignon's 2002 season was impressive, as he won the Eurocup by four points from Neel Jani, and lost the French title by just two points to Alexandre Prémat. In fourteen races, he won seven and finished on the podium a further three times. Continuing on the RDD in 2003, Salignon moved to the British Formula 3 Championship driving for David Hayle's Hitech Racing team. Teaming up with fellow RDD driver Danny Watts, Salignon claimed a solitary pole position at Thruxton, and led that race until five laps from the end, colliding with the eventual champion Alan van der Merwe. He redeemed himself with his best finish of the season at the following round at Spa with second place. He eventually finished twelfth in the championship, but was consequently dropped by Renault for the RDD. For 2004, Salignon moved into the Formula Three Euroseries driving for the ASM team, joining his former Formula Renault rival Prémat and British driver Jamie Green, who had competed against Salignon in British F3. Salignon won races at Estoril, Adria and Zandvoort before leaving the team, whilst lying in third place in the championship. He ended up finishing sixth in the standings, and was also the runner-up to Prémat at the prestigious Masters of Formula 3, also at Zandvoort. After leaving ASM, Salignon signed up to compete in the World Series by Renault for its debut season in 2005, with the series having previously been named the World Series by Nissan. He competed for the Cram Competition team, and ended up tenth overall tying on points with Jaap van Lagen. He did miss the Estoril rounds of the championship though, with British driver Ben Hanley replacing him. Hanley ended up taking Salignon's seat at Cram for the 2006, with Salignon moving to Interwetten. Salignon started the season off with a double win at Zolder, which was only ratified a month after the conclusion of the season. Salignon had lost the first of his two wins, due to the race results being completely annulled, after protests from a rival team. He had since left the team by the time he got his second win back, having been replaced by Franck Perera for the final round, in order for his team to successfully clinch the teams championship. Since being replaced, he has not taken part in any major international championship.  Driver did not finish the race, but was classified as he completed more than 90% of the race distance. 

A white light scanner (WLS) is a device for performing surface height measurements of an object using coherence scanning interferometry (CSI) with spectrally-broadband, "white light" illumination. Different configurations of scanning interferometer may be used to measure macroscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the centimeter range, to microscopic objects with surface profiles measuring in the micrometer range. For large-scale non-interferometric measurement systems, see structured-light 3D scanner. Vertical scanning interferometry is an example of low-coherence interferometry, which exploits the low coherence of white light. Interference will only be achieved when the path length delays of the interferometer are matched within the coherence time of the light source. VSI monitors the fringe contrast rather than the shape of the fringes. Fig. 2 illustrates a Twyman–Green interferometer set up for white light scanning of a macroscopic object. Light from the test specimen is mixed with light reflected from the reference mirror to form an interference pattern. Fringes appear in the CCD image only where the optical path lengths differ by less than half the coherence length of the light source, which is generally on the order of micrometers. The interference signal (correlogram) is recorded and analyzed as either the specimen or reference mirror is scanned. The focus position of any particular point on the surface of the specimen corresponds to the point of maximum fringe contrast (i.e. where the modulation of the correlogram is greatest). Fig. 3 illustrates a white light interferometric microscope using a Mirau interferometer in the objective. Other forms of interferometer used with white light include the Michelson interferometer (for low magnification objectives, where the reference mirror in a Mirau objective would interrupt too much of the aperture) and the Linnik interferometer (for high magnification objectives with limited working distance). The objective (or alternatively, the sample) is moved vertically over the full height range of the sample, and the position of maximum fringe contrast is found for each pixel. The chief benefit of low-coherence interferometry is that systems can be designed that do not suffer from the 2 pi ambiguity of coherent interferometry, and as seen in Fig. 1, which scans a 180 μm × 140 μm × 10 μm volume, it is well suited to profiling steps and rough surfaces. The axial resolution of the system is determined by the coherence length of the light source and is typically in the micrometer range. Industrial applications include in-process surface metrology, roughness measurement, 3D surface metrology in hard-to-reach spaces and in hostile environments, profilometry of surfaces with high aspect ratio features (grooves, channels, holes), and film thickness measurement (semi-conductor and optical industries, etc.). White-light interferometry scanning (WLS) systems capture intensity data at a series of positions along the vertical axis, determining where the surface is located by using the shape of the white-light interferogram, the localized phase of the interferogram, or a combination of both shape and phase. The white light interferogram actually consists of the superposition of fringes generated by multiple wavelengths, obtaining peak fringe contrast as a function of scan position, that is, the red portion of the object beam interferes with the red portion of the reference beam, the blue interferes with the blue, and so forth. In a WLS system, an imaging interferometer is vertically scanned to vary the optical path difference. During this process, a series of interference patterns are formed at each pixel in the instrument field of view. This results in an interference function, with interference varying as a function of optical path difference. The data are stored digitally and processed in a variety of ways depending on the system manufacturer, including being Fourier-transformed into frequency space, subject to cross-correlation methods, or analysis in the spatial domain. If a Fourier transform is used, the original intensity data are expressed in terms of interference phase as a function of wavenumber. Wavenumber k is a representation of wavelength in the spatial frequency domain, defined by k = 2π/λ. If phase is plotted versus wavenumber, the slope of the function corresponds to the relative change in group-velocity optical path difference D by D = D/2n where n is group-velocity index of refraction. If this calculation is performed for each pixel, a three-dimensional surface height map emerges from the data. In the actual measuring process, the optical path difference is steadily increased by scanning the objective vertically using a precision mechanical stage or piezoelectric positioner. Interference data are captured at each step in the scan. In effect, an interferogram is captured as a function of vertical position for each pixel in the detector array. To sift through the large amount of data acquired over long scans, many different techniques can be employed. Most methods allow the instrument to reject raw data that do not exhibit sufficient signal-to-noise. The intensity data as a function of the optical path difference are processed and converted to height information of the sample.

He made his debut in the Russian Premier League on 11 March 2012 for FC Krylia Sovetov Samara in a game against FC Rostov. In the summer 2013 he was loaned out to Mordovia Saransk and played there for the first half of the 2013–14 season. 

Ann Victoria "A V." Christie (February 2, 1963 – April 7, 2016) was an American poet. Ann Victoria Christie was born in Redwood City, California. She was raised in California's San Francisco Bay area as well as in Montana, and British Columbia. A graduate of Vassar College, she received her master of fine arts degree from the University of Maryland. She was a visiting writer and writer-in-residence at colleges along the Pennsylvania Main Line and regionally, including Villanova and La Salle universities; Bryn Mawr College; Goucher College in Baltimore; the University of Maryland, College Park; and Penn State Abington. Her first poetry collection, Nine Skies, won the 1996 National Poetry Series prize. The poet Henri Cole described it as "hard-bitten, luxuriant and true," and the Philadelphia-area poet Eleanor Wilner called it "diamond-faceted, elliptical." W.S. DiPiero said of her 2014 collection The Wonders that "her poems invoke and respect strangeness and make strangeness feel near." Her poems, reviews, and interviews appeared in "AGNI", "American Poetry Review", "Poetry", "Excerpt", "Iowa Review", "Commonweal", "The Journal", "Ploughshares", and "Prairie Schooner". Her collection The Housing (2004) was co-winner of the Robert McGovern Publication Prize. The Wonders (2014), a chapbook-length poem and Editor's Selection, was published by Seven Kitchens Press. Her chapbook And I Began to Entertain Doubts was published in May 2016 by Folded Word Press. Christie died of breast cancer in West Chester, Pennsylvania. She was 53.

Sweet Kill (also known as A Kiss from Eddie and The Arousers) is a 1973 B-movie written and directed by future Academy Award winner Curtis Hanson. The film was Hanson's directorial debut and was produced by Roger Corman. It stars 1950s heartthrob Tab Hunter and was the last film of actress Isabel Jewell. Eddie Collins finds that he is unable to perform sexually with women because of repressed memories of his mother. After accidentally killing a woman while trying to sleep with her, he finds that he is able to get aroused by the dead body. This leads him into a chain of luring women into bed in order to kill them for sexual gratification. Curtis Hanson got to know Roger Corman while doing re-writes on "The Dunwich Horror" (1970), which Corman had helped finance. Corman had a track record of giving opportunities to first time directors and was setting up his own distribution company, New World Pictures. When "Dunwhich Horror" was finished, Hanson told Corman he wanted to direct a film he had written; Corman said he would be interested in financing a motorcycle movie, a women in prison movie or a nurses movie. Hanson was unenthusiastic, so Corman then said he might also be interested in a modern horror film along the lines of "Psycho" (1960). Hanson wrote the script originally with the killer as a female. Corman liked it but felt it was "a little too different" for the killer to be female so asked she be turned male. The producer, Tamara Asseyev, was Corman's former assistant. According to Hanson, the film cost $130,000 and Corman was supposed to put up two-thirds of the money. A couple of weeks before filming started Hanson says Corman "reneged on the deal and said he would only put up one-third of the money. My producing partner and I had to raise the other two-thirds. To show how foolhardy I was, I went to my parents and persuaded them to put a mortgage on their home in order to finance this film." In November 1970, Tab Hunter signed to make the film. Isabelle Jewel, Cherie Latimer and Rita Murrie were also cast. At this stage the film was called A Kiss for Eddie. Filming took place in 1971. The apartment where Tab Hunter's character lived in Venice was owned by Hanson's grandmother. Hanson says when he showed the film to Corman "he said it needed more tits in it... It was my first nightmare post-production experience." Hanson says "It was recut to some degree and more bare breasts were put into it. It was the first time I learned the lesson that I had the opportunity to learn multiple times after that which is: If you're going to risk being wrong, it's better to be wrong with your own mistakes than with somebody else's. " "It was very low-budget and it was a really interesting script", said Hunter. "But, of course, Roger Corman had to put his own little tweaks into it (laughter). He had his own way of making motion pictures... and selling them." The film was originally released as "Sweet Kill". Box office performance was disappointing. The film was re-released as "The Arousers". It arrived in Los Angeles cinemas in 1976. The "Los Angeles Times" said it was "made with a sensitivity and intelligence unusual for the normally lurid psycho genre." Hanson later described the experience as a "very unhappy" one. 

Alastrim, also known as variola minor, was the milder strain of "Variola virus" that caused smallpox. The last known case of variola minor was in Somalia in 1977. Smallpox was formally declared eradicated on May 8, 1980. Variola minor is of the genus "Orthopoxvirus", which are DNA viruses that replicate in the cytoplasm of the affected cell, rather than in its nucleus. Like variola major, alastrim was spread through inhalation of the virus in the air, which could occur through face-to-face contact or through fomites. Infection with variola minor conferred immunity against the more dangerous variola major. Variola minor was a less common form of the virus, and much less deadly. Although alastrim had the same incubation period and pathogenetic stages as smallpox, alastrim is believed to have had a mortality rate of less than 1%, as compared to smallpox's 30%. Because alastrim was a less debilitating disease than smallpox, patients were more frequently ambulant and thus able to infect others more rapidly. As such, variola minor swept through the United States, Great Britain, and South Africa in the early 20th century, becoming the dominant form of the disease in those areas and thus rapidly decreasing mortality rates. Alastrim was also called white pox, kaffir pox, Cuban itch, West Indian pox, milk pox, and pseudovariola. Like smallpox, alastrim has now been totally eradicated from the globe thanks to the 1960s Global Smallpox Eradication campaign. The last case of indigenous variola minor was reported in a Somali cook, Ali Maow Maalin, in October 1977, and smallpox was officially declared eradicated worldwide in May 1980. 

Saedae was a government office of the Taebong state (also known as Later Goguryo or Majin), a short-lived kingdom (901–918) founded by Gung Ye during the Later Three Kingdoms period (892–936) of Korea. According to historical records in "Samguk Sagi" ("History of the Three Kingdoms"), as Gung Ye changed the name of the state to Majin (摩震) and named the era "Mutae" (武泰) in 904, he revised the administrative system in reference to those of Silla. In the process, he established "Gwangpyeongseong" (廣評省), the highest administrative office which consisted of 18 departments called "Gwanbu" including "Sadae" and "Byeongbu" (兵部). The Saedae office took charge of education on "yeogeo" or foreign language. According to the records, learning foreign languages was regarded as important in ancient Korean society. 

George Angus Garrett (August 5, 1888 – September 29, 1971) was an American investment banker and diplomat. In April 1947, he was appointed minister to Ireland; in 1950, he became the first United States Ambassador to Ireland, a position he held until May 1951. Garrett was born on August 5, 1888 in La Crosse, Wisconsin. He first attended Cornell University, before graduating in 1910 from the University of Chicago. During World War I he served in the United States Army. As a civilian he pursued a career as a stockbroker. In 1932, Garrett was a delegate to the Democratic National Convention. In April 1947, Garrett was appointed minister to Ireland by President Harry S. Truman, and became the last US chief of mission in Ireland with the formal title of Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary. In 1950, the post was raised to the level of ambassador, and Garrett was again appointed by Truman, becoming the first US chief of mission in Ireland with the formal title of Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary. Although Garrett's relations with Ireland's Taoiseach (prime minister) Éamon de Valera were not unfriendly, he made no secret of his pleasure when de Valera was replaced in 1948 by John A. Costello, for whom Garrett had the greatest admiration, and whom he thought a more reliable friend to the United States. Garrett died on September 29, 1971, and was entombed at the Washington National Cathedral. 

Holme railway station was located on the line between and Watlington in Norfolk, England. It served the parish of Runcton Holme, and closed in 1853. The Lynn & Ely Railway Bill received the Royal Assent on 30 June 1845. Work started on the line in 1846 and the line and its stations were opened on 27 October 1846. Holme Gate Station opened with the line and was situated South of St. Germain's Station and north of Stow Station. The line ran from Ely to Downham, the eventual destination being Ely. 

Richard Molyneux, 2nd Viscount Molyneux of Maryborough, (about 1617-1654) was a Royalist officer in the English Civil War Richard Molyneux was the son of Richard Molyneux, 1st Viscount Molyneux and Mary, daughter of Sir Thomas Caryll of Bentone, Sussex. He was born around 1630 and he inherited his title on his father's death in 1636. He married Lady Frances Seymour, but they had no children. On 20 June 1642 Molyneux attended the commission of array on Preston Moor, and assisted at the seizure of the magazine at Preston. On the outbreak of the Civil War he raised two regiments, one of horse and the other of foot, composed chiefly of Roman Catholics, for the service of the king, forming part of the Lancashire forces under the command of James Stanley, 7th Earl of Derby. Molyneux was present at the siege of Manchester in September 1642, and on 20 April 1643 was defeated by Captain Ashton at Whalley. After the surprise capture of Wakefield on 21 May 1643, the Earl of Derby being then with Queen Henrietta Maria at York, Molyneux was ordered to conduct the Lancashire forces thither. He was defeated on 20 August 1644 by Major-general Sir John Meldrum at the battle of Ormskirk, and narrowly escaped capture by hiding in a field of corn. He was at Oxford on 24 June 1646, when the city surrendered to the Parliament. On 30 June 1648 a warrant was signed by the Derby House Committee for his arrest, as having, contrary to an ordinance of Parliament, approached within twenty miles of London. He was suspected of being concerned in the rising of the royalist gentry at Kingston on 5 July, but four days later an order was issued for his discharge. Molyneux joined Charles II on his march to Worcester, and escaped after the battle on 3 September 1651, but died shortly afterwards, probably in 1654. He was succeeded by his brother, Caryll Molyneux, 3rd Viscount Molyneux (1621-1699), who played an active part during the Civil War on the Royalist side. Molyneux married Frances, eldest daughter of William, Marquis of Hertford, but had no children. 

Cesare Rossi (born 21 September 1887 in Pescia – died 9 August 1967 in Rome) was an Italian fascist leader who later became estranged from the regime. Rossi began his political career on the left with the Italian Socialist Party and as a writer for various syndicalist journals. However he left the Socialists in 1907 to serve in the Italian Army and did not rejoin following his demobilisation. Instead he embraced syndicalism fully by becoming a leading member of the "Unione Sindacale Italiana". He joined the "Fasci di Azione Rivoluzionaria" in 1914 and by 1919 this had led to him joining the "Fasci italiani di combattimento". A leading writer for "Il Popolo d'Italia", Rossi was recognised as one of Benito Mussolini's closest advisers in the early days of the fascist movement. Rossi soon gained a reputation for his moderation and was instrumental in the Pact of Pacification, a 1921 agreement that temporarily slowed down the violence of the Blackshirts. Working with Mussolini he also developed a strategy of trying to win over the left into a cross-class alliance. He attained the rank of assistant secretary of the movement in 1921 and was effective leader in Tuscany whilst he went on to sit on the National Fascist Party national council and the Grand Council of Fascism. He was the leader of a fasci and an important figure in the March on Rome. Following this seizure of power Rossi was appointed director of Mussolini's Press and Propaganda Office. He was also central in organising not only the 1924 election but also the reprisals against the areas that had rejected fascism which followed. A potential conflict of interest had arisen in February 1923 when Mussolini banned Fascist Party members from involvement in Freemasonry but ultimately the ban was not enforced as Rossi was just one of a number of Freemasons prominent within the party. Rossi's rise through the ranks of the fascist state came to an abrupt end in 1924 with the murder of Giacomo Matteotti after he was accused of being responsible. It was argued that Rossi, who had flown into a rage after one of the two speeches that sealed Matteotti's fate, had ordered his deputy Amerigo Dumini to kill the Socialist deputy for his anti-fascism. The incident, which angered even some fascists, led to a split between Rossi and Mussolini. Rossi fled to France and then Switzerland to escape prosecution and became a critic of fascism in his exile. He was tricked into returning to Italy in 1928 and was sentenced to 30 years imprisonment for his part in the murder. He was released after the fall of fascism and, following some investigations into his own past that acquitted him of involvement in the excesses of fascism, he returned to journalism and left politics behind. In the Florestano Vancini's film The Assassination of Matteotti (1973), Rossi is played by Cesare Barbetti. 

The Battle of the Mimbres River was a surprise attack launched by a troop of American militia against an encampment of Chiricahua Apaches along the western shore of the Mimbres River. On December 4, 1860 a force of thirty armed miners led by James Henry Tevis attacked at sunrise, claiming it was retaliation for stolen livestock. The surprised Apaches, led by Mangas Coloradas, were quickly defeated in a short close quarters action. Four warriors were killed and an unknown number were wounded. The settlers' casualties are unknown, if any at all. Thirteen women and children were captured and several warriors fled, leaving their families behind. Mangas Coloradas survived. The Americans recovered some of their livestock.

Bude Sea Pool is a partially man-made tidal swimming pool or lido in the rocks at Summerleaze Beach, Bude, Cornwall. In 1930, "The Thynne family" put up half the money to create the pool and its sunbathing terraces. Its size is 290 x 140 feet (approximate dimensions, as the pool is not symmetrical) with an area of about 3,500m³. The volume is about 4000 m³ or 880,000 gallons, depending on how much sand the sea washes in. RNLI and the Bude Surf Lifesaving Club use the pool for training and exams. The pool is open 365 days a year, but only lifeguarded by RNLI during high seasons. On 19 October 2010 BBC Cornwall reported that the pool may face funding cuts as part of Cornwall Council's spending review. The possibility of cuts has drawn significant levels of protest from residents of Bude and beyond. The Friends of Bude Sea Pool, a volunteer charity organisation, was formed in May 2011. The group aims to preserve, improve and enhance the sea pool as an amenity for the benefit of the community and visitors to the town. 

Linzhou Steel Corporation (林州钢铁) is a state-owned Chinese enterprise established in 1969. It employs 5,122 workers and pensioners on the regular payroll and 2,995 workers on the job. It produces about 400,000 tonnes of pig iron and 100,000 tonnes of cement a year. Though it is in Anyang City, authorities in Puyang, which was formed from part of Anyang, administer its operations. 

Anthony Michael Varvaro (born October 31, 1984) is an American former professional baseball pitcher. He was the Seattle Mariners' 12th round selection in the June 2005 Major League Baseball Draft and also played in Major League Baseball (MLB) with the Atlanta Braves and Boston Red Sox. Varvaro graduated from Curtis High School in Staten Island, New York in June 2002. He attended St. Johns University, where he graduated with a bachelor's degree in criminal justice. In 2004, he played collegiate summer baseball with the Harwich Mariners of the Cape Cod Baseball League. He appeared in five games with the Peoria Mariners in 2006, his first professional season. He limited opposing hitters to a .184 batting average. Varvaro lost his final two starts of the season on August 22 and August 27, pitching six innings while allowing three runs, two earned. Varvaro spent the 2007 season with the Single-A Wisconsin Timber Rattlers, making 22 appearances, 21 starts. He led Timber Rattlers with 112 strikeouts, while finishing fourth among all Mariners Minor Leaguers in that category. He allowed one run on four hits while striking out nine in a season-high seven innings on June 15 to earn the win. He went 1-1 with a 1.12 ERA, allowing only three runs while striking out 33 in 26 innings from June 10 to July 27. He was placed on the disabled list with a right elbow strain from June 20 to July 8. He struck out at least five batters in 12 games, including striking out a career-high 11 batters in five innings on July 27 against the Great Lakes Loons. Varvaro earned his first career save in only relief appearance of the season, allowing two runs on one hit while walking two and striking out nine in four innings on August 17. He spent the season with the Class-A High Desert Mavericks, appearing in 30 games, 24 starts. He struck out seven or more batters five times, including a season-high nine strikeouts on May 25. He won back-to-back starts May 25 and May 30. He was transferred to the Double-A West Tenn Diamond Jaxx on September 2 for the playoffs and appeared in one game in relief. In 2009 Varvaro split the season with the Mavericks and Diamond Jaxx. He made it to the Southern League All-Star Team. Varvaro participated in the Arizona Fall League playing for the Peoria Javelinas. He was placed on the Mariners' 40-man roster on November 20. On September 22, 2010, Varvaro was called up by the Seattle Mariners along with 4 others following the conclusion of the Tacoma Rainiers season. On January 13, 2011 the Atlanta Braves claimed Varvaro off waivers. Varvaro was called up from Triple-A Gwinnett in late July 2011 and made a couple of appearances out of the bullpen. He was re-called on September 1, 2011. Varvaro compiled a 2.74 ERA in the 123 appearances he made from 2013–14, as he pitched in varied situations, from long relief to right-handed specialist roles. He was designated for assignment on December 15, 2014. On December 17, 2014, Varvaro was traded to the Boston Red Sox in exchange for minor leaguer Aaron Kurcz. He was designated for assignment by the Red Sox on April 29, 2015. He then was claimed off waivers by the Chicago Cubs on May 3. However, the Cubs discovered a torn flexor tendon in his pitching arm. As a result, Varvaro was returned to the Red Sox and required season-ending surgery, being subsequently placed on the disabled list on May 24. After recovering, the Sox announced they had signed him to a minor league contract on December 15. In 2016 Varvaro was assigned to Triple A Pawtucket Red Sox, where he posted a 3-2 record with a 2.83 ERA and one save in 18 relief appearances, striking out 31 batters while walking 13 in 28⅔ innings of work. Varvaro retired from baseball in June 2016 to begin police training with the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, and officially became a Port Authority police officer in December 2016. Varvaro married Kerry Thomson in 2011. They have four children.

The Epic of Gilgamesh, or This Unnameable Little Broom (aka Little Songs of the Chief Officer of Hunar Louse) is a 1985 stop motion short film by The Brothers Quay. The film is loosely based on the first tablet of "Epic of Gilgamesh". Boasting the longest title in the Quays' entire output, this 1985 film is generally known as "This Unnameable Little Broom". The short began life as a proposed hour-long program Channel 4 exploring aspects of the ancient Babylonian "Epic of Gilgamesh", one of the oldest known surviving works of literature, which would combine puppet animation, dance sequences, and live-action documentary elements. However, Channel Four were unsure about the project, and only agreed to fund a short animated sequence as a pilot - which is all that was ultimately made. In the film, Gilgamesh is a grotesque, Picasso-esque being who moves by tricycle and patrols his box-shaped kingdom that hovers above a dark abyss. The yellow walls are inscribed with calligraphic text and its seemingly vast expanse is randomly broken up by square holes from which medical hooks occasionally project. A table – a mechanism and a trap – concealing a pulsating vagina within one of its drawers, stands at the centre of Gilgamesh’s domain. High above this space are strung high-tension wires, vibrating in the wind, one caught with a broken tennis racquet. First, Gilgamesh is seen setting up a bizarre trap to lure and catch the wild man Enkidu (who is depicted as a bird-like creature, partially made of genuine animal skeletons). Enkidu appears to live in a distant forest world visible through a hatch in the side of one of the walls of the floating kingdom. Gilgamesh is seen eating dandelion fluff during the opening credits before he finishes readying the trap. Once finished, Gilgamesh retreats to a room beneath the floor of the floating kingdom, awaiting Enkidu's arrival. Sometime later, Enkidu enters and becomes intrigued by a table with an anatomical, H.R. Giger/da Vinci-esque image of a woman's muscles (symbolizing the character Shamhat). The mechanism activates allowing Enkidu to look inside the image revealing a swaying piece of meat on a hook within the woman's body. A drawer on the table opens, revealing the pulsating vagina. Ecstatic, Enkidu begins to mount the table, which sets off Gilgamesh's trap, flinging him onto the high-tension wires. An excited Gilgamesh resurfaces, retrieving the ensnared Enkidu by means of a giant gold cloth. Gilgamesh binds his captive with twine, beats him with a spiked club, and brushes his wings before cutting them off with scissors. Gilgamesh cuts the twine binding Enkidu and as the gold cloth falls to the ground the viewer is given a shot of Enkidu’s forest. The same fluff that Gilgamesh was eating earlier litters the forest floor and the viewer is allowed to observe an insect husk rapidly decay. In the end, Gilgamesh is seen riding frenzied circles around Enkidu, who is now trapped beneath the table-mechanism on which the trap was set. As a symbolic representation, Gilgamesh’s world is one of evil and deceit, simultaneously laced with psychosexual tension and personal resonance for the Quays. The medical hooks, rusting scissors, and razor sharp high-tension wires all imply a castration theme, accentuated not just by the sadistic mechanical trap that Gilgamesh sets but also by the sequence in which he places two eggs on a slicing wicket, positioning them where his own testicles should be. Such brutal and sexually violent imagery would reoccur in the brothers’ other films, most notably in "Street of Crocodiles", where organic materials are organized into representations of male genitals then pierced with tailor's pins. In the epic poem Gilgamesh is King of Uruk and oppresses his citizens. In the Quays’ adaption he is lord over an isolated kingdom where he is the sole denizen. In the Epic Enkidu is a Wildman created by the gods to distract Gilgamesh from his questionable activities. Enkidu is spotted uprooting traps, ruining a trapper's trade. Enkidu is then seduced by Shamhat, a temple prostitute, the first step in civilizing him. The Brothers version shows Enkidu first being seduced by Shamhat, leading him into a trap that Gilgamesh has set for him. The film had many inspirations besides the Gilgamesh legend. The violence that pervades the film is a tribute to Austrian writer Konrad Bayer, the physical design of Gilgamesh was based on artwork by Heinrich Anton Müller, one of a trio of artists that the Quays originally intended to dedicate their film to. 'Hunar Louse' is a satirical representation of Lunar House in London, the headquarters of the UK Border Agency, which called the Quays' visa status into question at the time they were making the film. Though this was distressing at the time, the experience helped create the paranoid atmosphere that saturates the film. 

Linzhou (), formerly Lin County or Linxian (()), is a county-level city in Anyang, Henan, China. Adjacent to Shanxi Province and Hebei Province, it is located in the north of Henan Province and at the eastern foot of the Taihang Mountains. It covers an area of 2046 square kilometers and has a population of about one million. Linzhou is well known for its Red Flag Canal, which was constructed in the 1960s. 

Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Wars (also known as Bucky O'Hare and the Toad Menace in Canada) is a French-American animated series created by Sunbow Productions, Abrams/Gentile Entertainment, Continuity Comics and the French company IDDH, co-produced by Marvel Productions and distributed by Hasbro's subsidiary Claster Television. It was based on the cult comic "Bucky O'Hare", and animated by AKOM. It debuted in 1991 in the United States, and 1992 in the UK on the BBC. Most of the ideas from the comic book were used for the cartoon, with several major differences: The parallel universe the story takes place in is named the "Aniverse", Willy DuWitt can travel freely between Earth and the Aniverse instead of being stranded there, Bruce is transported into another dimension instead of killed, the Toad Empire are willingly following KOMPLEX instead of brainwashed, Deadeye has a Southern accent instead of a Scottish accent, the nigh-omnipotent mouse is nowhere to be seen, and Jenny reveals her psionic powers to Willy DuWitt. The cartoon explored more of the aniverse and followed a loose unifying arc, with Bucky's home planet of Warren being captured by the toads in the season premiere and rescued in the finale (which was co-written by Neal Adams). Bucky and his crew are members of the S.P.A.C.E. organization, which stands for Sentient Protoplasm Against Colonial Encroachment. The members of the Toad Empire introduced are as follows: Almost all the characters listed above are both from the comic book and the cartoon. Most of the new ones that were introduced are listed below. Family Home Entertainment released seven out of thirteen episodes of the show on three VHS cassettes in North America. In the United Kingdom, BBC Video released twelve out of the thirteen episodes across six VHS tapes, then Metrodome Entertainment released all thirteen episodes on a Region 2 DVD set, as well as a single volume DVD, which both are now out of print. 

Turgoyak () is a lake in Chelyabinsk Oblast, near the city of Miass, Russia. It has a surface of 2638 hectares. The water of the lake has a great transparency (from 10-17.5 m). The quality of the water is comparable to that of Lake Baikal. A megalithic monument is found on an island in the lake (Vera island), as well as ruins of a monastery. The lake is a popular tourist destination with resorts and holiday camps. 

Robert Newlyn (1597–1688) was an English clergyman and academic. He was President of Corpus Christi College, Oxford from 1640 to 1648, was expelled by the parliamentary visitation of Oxford, and returned as President in 1660. He was born in Priors Dean, Hampshire. He matriculated at Oxford in 1614 and graduated B.A. at Corpus Christi, in 1616, M.A. in 1620. He became a Fellow of his college in 1622. He was B.D. in 1628, and D.D. in 1640. He became rector of Ham, Wiltshire in 1643. In 1659 he married Jane, daughter of Daniel Collins and William Dring. They had no children, but his second presidency was noted for the conspicuous nepotism Newlyn applied to admissions and college posts. He was rector of Wroughton, Wiltshire from 1660.

Elston Hall, formerly the Hotel Van Curler, is located on Washington Street in the city of Schenectady, New York, United States. It is a tall brick building constructed in 1925 in the Classical Revival architectural style. Its construction was partially financed by local employers General Electric and the American Locomotive Company, which needed space for new workers to live and wanted an architecturally distinctive building comparable with large city hotels of the era. Today, it is one of the main buildings of Schenectady County Community College. Elston Hall is located at the northeast corner of the college property, right at the corner of State (NY 5) and Washington streets. Only the two acres (8,000 m²) on which the building sits is included in the listing. To the south Washington feeds into Interstate 890; the Schenectady Armory, also listed on the National Register, is located almost across Washington. Directly across from the building, on the east side of Washington, is a garden with a fountain. On the north Washington is part of the Stockade Historic District, the oldest section of Schenectady. One block to the west, State crosses the Mohawk River via the Western Gateway Bridge to Scotia. The building itself is six stories high, faced in limestone-trimmed brick over a reinforced concrete frame. It is H-shaped, with the north wing shorter than the south due to an extension of the main dining room, topped by a gabled roof with wooden eaves shingled in slate. Some other wings have been built on to the structure since the college began using it. They are too modern to be considered contributing to its historic character. Six Corinthian columns support the main entrance portico. Its entablature, with the words "SCHENECTADY COUNTY COMMUNITY COLLEGE" on it in metal lettering, is topped by a dentilled cornice and flat roof with balustrade. Each pillar of the balustrade continues a column below and is topped with a decorative carved urn. The basement level is marked by a stone watercourse. The first floor is fenestrated with alternating rectangular and Palladian windows, and has a belt course of alternating brick and stone dividing it and the second story. White rosettes are between them and their lintels are of white stone with a keystone motif. Some windows are further embellished with swag-decorated friezes. The front doors are surmounted by broken-arch pediments with carved acorns set in blind arches. Decoration is more limited on the upper stories, with each window having just a simple stone sill and lintel. Another belt course like the lower one sets off the top story. The sixth floor's three central windows are each topped with a blind lunette and have iron balconies. The central five bays of the main block are further set off by rusticated stone quoins at the corner and five brick pilasters supporting a pediment and balustrade on the roofline. On the wings, there are similar touches. The south side's main entrance is a domed portico with classical detail, matched on the north wing by Ionic columns supporting a flat, dentilled entablature. The belt courses and fenestration are similar to those on the main block. The central window of the fifth (top) story on each wing is marked by a blind carved lunette and balcony, with a blind oculus in the gable. On the inner walls, the central of the three bays has a small circular or square window, alternating by story. A two-story kitchen wing projects from the north. Its windows have been bricked in but have similar decorative patterns (arches and rectangles) to the rest of the building. Two more modern wings, neither contributing, extend from it as well, as does as a large wing from the south of similar materials to the main block. Three emergency exit towers on the corners of the building likewise do not contribute as modern additions. The first floor retains much of its original finishing. The lobby is in a Georgian mode, with pillars, pilasters and paneling. Its flooring is terrazzo with a genuine marble as a wall base. Another keystoned, lunetted door leads to the Lobby Lounge. Other designs from the exterior, such as the broken-arched niches with acorns, are also repeated inside. The Lobby Lounge itself, now known as the Mohawk Room, is a room with a semicircular wall. Five sets of double doors overlook the garden and river beyond. Its fireplaces and lunettes on the interior doors are original. The fanlights on the exterior doors are also original but they have been covered with shells on the inside to conceal indirect interior lighting. Just off the Lobby Lounge, the Reception Room now serves as the college president's office. It has most of its original finishes and has not been altered. The former Dining Room and Assembly Room were combined to make a single Ballroom, and are still together today although they can be divided with a partition. Its original western wall has mostly been removed. What was originally a small private dining room between the Lobby Lounge and Dining Room has now become part of a hallway connecting the building and its western annex. It is lit by the only remaining original chandelier in the hotel building. The upper stories have been gutted to serve college purposes. Nothing of their original layout or finish is left. H.L. Stevens & Co., the hotel's designers, specialized in small (less than 500 rooms) hotels and apartment houses in a neo-Georgian or Colonial Revival style in either a rectangular or H-shape, seen by the city's Chamber of Commerce as a refreshing change from the small, squarish hotels the city had previously possessed. Their buildings, primarily in the Northeast, are in many cases still extant and show similarities to the Van Curler. Most similar to the Van Curler is the Burritt Hotel in New Britain, Connecticut, also listed on the Register. It is also of brick, has nearly identical limestone decoration and is also H-shaped. The Colonial Hotel in Gardner, Massachusetts, also has a similar design except for the projecting wings and the Federal style decoration at the top. To facilitate it use as a center for local functions, it was designed so that the ballrooms could be entered without having to cross the lobby, seen as the space for commercial travelers. The Georgian Revival style was used for other buildings in the city at the same period, most notably City Hall in 1933. In the 35 years leading up to the hotel's 1925 construction, Schenectady's population quintupled, making it the fastest-growing city in New York. It became ten times as wealthy. Both of these developments were a result of the city becoming the headquarters of General Electric (GE) and the American Locomotive Company (ALCO). The two corporations contributed $300,000 of the hotel's $700,000 ($ in contemporary dollars) construction cost. The local Chamber of Commerce and a thousand citizens filled in the rest. It was named after Arendt van Curler, the Dutch explorer who first saw the site of Schenectady in 1661. Ultimately it would cost $1.1 million ($ in contemporary dollars) The Stevens firm was chosen for the design, due to its successful similar contemporary buildings. A branch of the Mohawk River, the Binne Kill was filled in, streets were widened, a sea wall was built along the Mohawk to the Rotterdam line, and streets were widened. The hotel was publicly owned, so some smaller nearby hotels were torn down to eliminate competition. The building became a focus of civic pride, hosting many major events even as the city declined due to suburbanization, GE began moving work elsewhere and ALCO went into decline along with its industry. In addition to the many local functions it hosted, it became a popular lunch spot for workers at the nearby GE plant. Among its many notable guests over the years were then-governor Franklin D. Roosevelt and his wife Eleanor, John Philip Sousa, Clement Attlee and Robert F. Kennedy. In 1954 the additions were built to accommodate the increasing demands of business travelers. Every one of the new rooms had air conditioning and a private bath. These rooms rented well, but increasingly guests preferred them to the old section of the hotel, with an overall negative effect on the hotel's occupancy rate. It declared bankruptcy in 1968. Schenectady County bought the building at the ensuing public auction for $710,000 ($ in contemporary dollars), and converted it for its current use by the college. The college's board of trustees renamed it after Charles Elston, the longtime chairman of the county's Board of Representatives.

Vrtanes Mesrop Papazian (; 1866–1920), was an Armenian writer, public-political and cultural activist, literary critic, editor, literature historian, teacher and translator. Vrtanes Papazian was born in the city of Van, Ottoman Empire, in 1866. His father, archimandrite Mesrop Papazyan, was a well-known religious and public figure, pedagogue, writer, theater expert, and playwright. At the age of four he moved with his parents to Agulis where he received his primary education. He continued his study at the Aramian School in Tavriz and Gevorgian Theological Seminary in Etchmiadzin. Later he studied at the Geneva University, the faculty of literature and social sciences. Hard conditions made him start working at the age of 15 and wander from city to city, country to country. He worked as a laborer, photographer and telegrapher. For a long period he was teaching at schools in several cities (Van, Karin, Tbilisi, Tehran, Shoushi, Bucharest etc.). He worked as the editor of newspapers "Free Armenia", "Struggle" of the Armenian revolutionist labourer association (Tbilisi), of the weekly "Path" (Tehran) and of the weekly "Karabakh" (Shoushi). He cooperated with a number of Armenian, Russian and European press organs. The events of the 1915 genocide did not pass by his family. His brother, Nerses Papazyan (archimandrite Mashtots), abbot of Armenian Church in the northern American cities of Ustr and Boston, was arrested on 24 April 1915 in Constantinople and killed by the Turkish executioners. The literary legacy of Vrtanes Papazian is regarded as the twin of his life – a valiant fighting of pen against national and social oppression, struggle for national survival and bright future. Looking into historical and current standards of various nations the writer referred to the Armenian life and culture in the light of those standards assessing national realities upon a wide range of criteria. His prolific literary creation is an outcome of a wide sphere of mental activity – prose, dramaturgy, poetry, literary criticism, history of literature, producer work, music, pedagogy, linguistics, translation, logics, psychology etc. Early writings of Papazian are about the life of Western Armenians. During the 1890s these stories appeared in the press. Later they were published in two books: "Scenes from the Life of Turkish Armenians" (1889) and "Stories from the Life of Turkish Armenians" (1904). Speaking about the horrors by Turks and Kurds, he did not ignore the national oppressors showing that their conduct was equally horrible. Papazian condemned servility and fawn, setting forward tragic scenes from Western Armenian struggle against the organizers of genocide and creating characters of valiant individuals (“Kheran”, “Lightning”, “Light Pleasures”, “The Dying are Greeting You”). He holds a relentless debate against any vicious opinion. The novel "Emma" strongly criticizes some national parties as being separated from the nation. While based in European countries far from the homeland these parties proclaim themselves as leaders of struggle against tyranny.

In track & field, Moye was one of the state's top sprinters. He recorded a career-best time of 11.04 seconds in the 100-meter dash at the 2006 Pennsylvania T&F State Championships, where he took 7th in the finals. He won the 200-meter dash (22.04 s) and 400-meter dash (48.04 s) Class AA state titles at the 2007 Pennsylvania T&F State Championships. Moye entered the 2009 season starting at wide receiver.

In the 4th and final pre-season game, an errant pass intended for Moye was intercepted by Carolina Panthers defensive back Josh Norman at Carolina's 8-yard line; Moye ran the length of the field and made a spectacular tackle. Some felt this effort and determination in the final preseason game helped him secure the fifth and final WR spot on the 53 man roster. Moye caught the first touchdown of his professional career in Week 2 of the 2013 season, during Pittsburgh's 20-10 loss to the Cincinnati Bengals on Monday Night Football. He was signed to the Tennessee Titans practice squad on October 22, 2014.

The Scott County Library System is the library system in Scott County, Iowa. It is headquartered in Eldridge, Iowa, Before the Scott County Library system was established, a bookmobile went into operation on a voluntary basis. The Scott County Bookmobile, Inc. was organized June 16, 1947 . Edna Spies served as the president, driver, and librarian of the organization until the March 1950. The first purchased bookmobile was a retrofitted school bus. In 1948, Scott County voters agreed to a request for tax support establishing a countywide library system. A headquarters was opened in January 1950 in the Eckermann Implement building in downtown Eldridge, with the intention that it would serve the bookmobile. The 25-by-52-square-foot space functioned as a library, and a garage was constructed for the bookmobile. Three months after the library opened, 4,000 books had been received and processed by Director Elizabeth Hage and her staff of three. The library continued to grow, registering 643 patrons by August of that year. Arrangements were made with the Scott County Bookmobile to gain access to the unit's mobile library, and by May 1950 the bookmobile began serving all 16 communities in Scott County, visiting three or more towns per day. Throughout the summer the Bookmobile had a single purpose of providing reading to adults and children in the rural communities; but in the fall through winter it serviced 110 schools throughout Scott County. Branches were established in Blue Grass, Eldridge and Princeton. The Walcott Branch was opened in 1952, and the Buffalo Branch opened in 1962.  The city of Durant contracted for library services with the Scott County Library System beginning in 1966. At one time, the library also had branches in LeClaire, Long Grove, New Liberty, Park View and Ridgeview (now part of Davenport), but these have since close "Branching Out- Scott County Library System."

In probability theory, the chain rule (also called the general product rule) permits the calculation of any member of the joint distribution of a set of random variables using only conditional probabilities. The rule is useful in the study of Bayesian networks, which describe a probability distribution in terms of conditional probabilities. The chain rule for two random events formula_1 and formula_2 says This rule is illustrated in the following example. Urn 1 has 1 black ball and 2 white balls and Urn 2 has 1 black ball and 3 white balls. Suppose we pick an urn at random and then select a ball from that urn. Let event formula_1 be choosing the first urn: formula_5. Let event formula_2 be the chance we choose a white ball. The chance of choosing a white ball, given that we have chosen the first urn, is formula_7. Event formula_8 would be their intersection: choosing the first urn and a white ball from it. The probability can be found by the chain rule for probability: For more than two events formula_10 the chain rule extends to the formula which by induction may be turned into With four events (formula_13), the chain rule is For two random variables formula_15, to find the joint distribution, we can apply the definition of conditional probability to obtain: Consider an indexed collection of random variables formula_17. To find the value of this member of the joint distribution, we can apply the definition of conditional probability to obtain: Repeating this process with each final term creates the product: With four variables (formula_13), the chain rule produces this product of conditional probabilities: 

Be Our Guest Restaurant is a quick service and table service restaurant in Fantasyland at Magic Kingdom in the Walt Disney World Resort. The restaurant has the theme and appearance of the Beast's Castle from Disney's 1991 animated film "Beauty and the Beast". The name of the restaurant is a reference to "Be Our Guest", one of the classic songs from that film. The restaurant was added as part of a large expansion and renovation to Fantasyland. It opened in late 2012, and the rest of Fantasyland was completed in 2014. "The New Fantasyland will be constructed in phases with most new experiences open by 2013." In September 2009, it was announced at the D23 Expo that Fantasyland would be expanded to incorporate Disney Princess characters, along with a larger 3 ring circus-themed Dumbo area. Recent conceptual artwork for the expansion shows several new additions and changes. Included is a new area themed to Disney's "Beauty and the Beast" featuring the Beast's Castle with a new dining experience, Gaston's tavern, and Belle's cottage. The castle features a full table service restaurant at night, and provides counter service dining by day, both requiring reservations. Cuisine is French-inspired. Three dining rooms are located within the castle, including the ballroom where Belle and the Beast danced, the West Wing where the rose is kept, and a gallery with paintings and a 7' wooden music box depicting Belle and Beast. The restaurant features baroque windows reaching the ceiling, and murals depicting the Enchanted Rose and characters from the film, including Belle, the Beast, Mrs. Potts, Chip, Lumière, and Cogsworth. The restaurant was the only publicly accessible Magic Kingdom venue to serve wine and beer (available exclusively at Dinner) prior to December 23, 2016, when additional restaurants at Magic Kingdom added it to their menus. On March 20, 2015, Be Our Guest Restaurant began to serve breakfast meals featuring foods such as eggs florentine and an open-faced-egg-and-poached-bacon sandwich. It was announced that the Beast's Castle would be included as part of a meet-and-greet with Belle. The Storytime with Belle attraction which originally was located in the Fairytale Gardens is now performed in the library inside the Beast's Castle. Guests can visit Belle's father's cottage, located at the former site of Ariel's Grotto. They can explore the home and encounter a magic mirror (a gift from the Beast) in Maurice's workshop which transports them to the Beast's Castle. Inside, they meet an audio-animatronic Madame Wardrobe who casts some guests as objects. Guests then head to the library and meet an audio-animatronic Lumiere who surprises a live Belle with guests and he will tell the classic story with help from her the selected guests. This attraction opened in December 2012. Outside the castle and Belle's house is Gaston's tavern, another restaurant. It is themed to look like the tavern where Gaston sings his title song in the original film. The tavern features a portrait of Gaston over a large fireplace. Antlers and buckskins hang upon the wall, which is lined with barrels. Mugs and goblets can be purchased, but alcohol is not served. Instead, a non-alcoholic beverage has been created called "Lefou's Brew" which is an apple soda with a marshmallow foam topping, which looks like the beer served in Gaston's tavern in the film during the song. Just outside is a water fountain of Gaston, holding barrels, with his foot on Le Fou, holding mugs. A gift shop inspired by the village where Belle lived in the film is also part of the area.

Modelo Museum of Science and Industry (Spanish: "Museo Modelo de Ciencia e Industria", MUMCI), is located in Toluca, capital city of Estado de Mexico. MUMCI's main goal is fostering people's interest in industry and related sciences. Besides permanent and temporary exhibitions, MUMCI offers other services, such as workshops, conferences, IMAX theatre, Ludotec, restaurant, bar, gift shop, and two parking lots. The museum was inaugurated on 30 June 2009 by Felipe Calderón, President of Mexico. MUMCI is an educational space with 21 rooms. Out of them, 15 rooms show different industrial branches, including: brewing, glass, metal-mechanics, cardboard and paper, among others. MUMCI also has 6 exhibit rooms showing the human side of the industry: Industry's history and the stakeholders. All these subjects were organized using an innovative multimedia concept. Furthermore, the museum has a special area for temporary exhibitions supplementing MUMCI's contents. MUMCI is the result of the humanitarian vision of Grupo Modelo, a leading company in the brewing industry. The selection process for the architectural drawings to remodel and restore the venue began in 2004. For over four years, more than a hundred experts of different industrial sectors contributed with practical and theoretical knowledge to the curatorial scripts of each room. The museographic production work immediately followed each script. With the architectural works still in progress, the mounting arrangements began in 2008 and were completed in the summer 2009, upon MUMCI's inauguration. MUMCI's venue is the building of the old brewery "Compañía Cervecera Toluca y México", located in front of Zaragoza Garden, in Toluca's historical downtown. The property dates back to the turn of the 19th century, when one of the leading breweries during Porfirio Diaz administration was built, home to the Mexican beer with the longest tradition, Victoria Beer. The restoration works on the building began in 2007 as part of the architectural project and lay-out proposal for a museum of science and industry, presented by Architect José de Arimatea Moyao. The office building and the corridor where the educational workshops are currently located were preserved. A historical research work authorized by INAH (National Institute of History and Anthropology) was conducted to distinguish the original spaces from subsequent construction works.

Vilho Annala (17 January 1888 – 28 July 1960) was a Finnish civil servant, economist and far right politician. Annala was born in Lapua, and first came to prominence as a student at the University of Helsinki, where he edited the student union newspaper "Ylioppilaslehti" from 1916 to 1919. He went on to work for the Bureau of Statistics, whilst serving on the editorial staff of the conservative daily "Uusi Suomi". He gained a doctorate in 1932 and became one of Finland's leading civil servants. Annala joined the Lapua Movement and became Helsinki District Chairman in February 1931. Ideologically Annala was heavily influenced by the corporatism of Italian fascism. He supported the co-opting of the working classes into the Lapua Movement and opposed the influence of wealthy industrialists. In April 1932 Annala joined Herman Gummerus and Erkki Räikkönen in founding the Patriotic People's Movement (IKL) and he served as caucus chairman from 1936 to 1944. Between 1933 and 1945 he also represented the party in the Parliament of Finland. Whilst the official leader was Vihtori Kosola real control of the movement rested with Annala and his close lieutenant Bruno Salmiala. It was Annala who dictated the policy of the movement although his hard-line views led to condemnation by both the government and the Evangelical Lutheran Church of Finland that damaged the group. Annala held the post of Minister of Transport in the unity government of Johan Wilhelm Rangell from 1941 to 1943. This however was a last throw for the IKL as the group faded soon afterwards and Annala left politics. With his political career over Annala became an academic back at the University of Helsinki. He served there as the professor of political economy 1951–57. He died in Helsinki, aged 72.

By 1869 the armament had been reduced to a single muzzle-loading gun and two 40-pounders. "Rapid" was commissioned under Commander Charles Jago at Woolwich on 12 June 1862. Commander Jago took the ship to the Cape of Good Hope Station where she remained until 1866, paying off at Woolwich on 24 January 1867. She was recommissioned at Woolwich on 14 May 1868 by Commander Francis Wood and served in the Mediterranean. While in the Mediterranean she had been converted from fully ship-rigged to barque-rigged. Her guns were reduced from eleven to three; one 7.5-ton muzzle loader and two 40-pounder Armstrong breech loaders. She recommissioned at Malta on 9 August 1871 under Commander Victor Montagu. In September 1875 her next captain, Commander Seymour Smith, was invalided home, being replaced by Commander Adolphus Fitzgeorge. In 1878 she was attached to the Mediterranean fleet under Geoffrey Hornby. Commander Charles Penrose-Fitzgerald took command on 4 January 1878 when she was stationed at Corfu. The island had recently been transferred from British to Greek control, which had resulted in a decline in the local economy as British forces and their funding had been withdrawn. Her Armstrong guns had a reputation amongst their crews as 'two muzzle guns, what shoots inwards', due to the unreliability of the breech mechanism. It was felt they killed more of their operators than ever those fired upon. The 7.5-ton gun was intended to fire to either side of the ship, but the spare topmast was stored on the port side of the ship, preventing the gun being fired in that direction. This difficulty was corrected by Fitzgerald once he assumed command. At the request of the British consul, "Rapid" evacuated 180 Christian women and children from Tre Scogli and Santi Quaranta villages in Albania when an attack by Turkish troops was expected. Fitzgerald was first censured for exceeding his authority in doing this by Admiral Hornby, but the Admiralty confirmed he had acted under instructions. The villagers for the most part remained destitute in Corfu for many years. In the autumn of 1878 "Rapid" was ordered to Malta for her annual refit. She was then ordered to visit Syria for the winter. The summer of 1879 was spent again at Malta refitting the ship and exchanging the crew. Fitzgerald found this trying, as his good companions with whom he had enjoyed hunting wherever the ship visited, were departing. "Rapid" was ordered to Constantinople for the winter, to act as guard ship for the ambassador. Each of the Great Powers kept a small warship there in attendance. "Rapid" was paid off at Malta on 14 January 1881 and was broken up there in September of the same year. 

VEREX was an ad hoc committee assembled by the Third Review Conference of the Biological Weapons Convention (BWC) to research verification measures to enforce the BWC. The committee of experts analyzed strengths and weaknesses of their recommendations, criterion by which activities can be labeled as prohibited or permitted, cost of creating verification measures, and the degree to which measures might impact permitted research and development. Participants met in a series of four sessions from 1992-1993. In VEREX I, the first session of the committee, government experts assembled 21 potential methods for verification. Measures included surveillance, declaration of activities, and ways to inspect suspicious facilities. VEREX II focused its attention on the uses and limitations of technologies that could be used to implement the methods discussed in the previous session. The third session examined the advantages and disadvantages of each of the methods detailed in VEREX I. In September 1993, VEREX submitted its report, noting that using a combination of measures would be much more effective in enforcing the BWC than enacting any single all-purpose regulation. Delegates to the BWC responded by relegating the creation of draft proposals based upon the VEREX conclusions to be considered at the Fifth Review Conference in 2001. However, the United States firmly rejected the proposal fearing that its jurisdiction over the private sector would infringe upon biodefense research. 

Roberto Goitre (Turin, 1927 - Piacenza, 1980) was an Italian choirmaster, composer and teacher. Upon finishing his academic studies, Goitre devoted himself entirely to choral conducting. At the beginning of the 1960s, on invitation from Marcello Abbado, he became director of the choir of the "Giuseppe Nicolini" Conservatoire in Piacenza, where he taught until his death in 1980. In the 1970s Goitre turned his attention to the musical pedagogy of Zoltán Kodály and spent a significant amount of time in Hungary carrying out research. He also widened his knowledge of Italian and Hungarian folk tunes, which he made use of when creating exercises and examples to include in his own teaching method, the Cantar Leggendo (meaning "to sing whilst reading"), published in 1972 by the Suvini Zerboni publishing house . This method was a new way of teaching music, equally suitable for infants and adults, and was based on the idea that a child should be taught music like a language, or in other words, as a kind of musical mother tongue. Roberto Goitre founded two choirs, the Piccoli Cantori in Turin in 1972 and the Coro Polifonico Farnesiano in Piacenza in 1976. The current directors of these choirs, Carlo Pavese and Mario Pigazzini, still use the Cantar Leggendo method exclusively. Goitre dedicated all his life to musical pedagogy and choral music. It was indeed he who, at the start of the 1970s, founded the magazine La Cartellina, which is still today a very important magazine on choral music and musical pedagogy. The current editor of this magazine is Marco Boschini.

Nostradamus Effect is an American sensationalist television series that premiered on September 9, 2009, on the History channel. The program detailed various historical apocalyptic prophecies, such as the 2012 phenomenon. The show was named after reputed French seer Michel de Nostredame, more commonly known as Nostradamus. The series ran for a single season. It presented itself in a "documentary style" but it was not a documentary. The show's disclaimer stated that it does not take sides regarding the apocalyptic prophecies. In the introduction of each episode, the narrator states, "We will neither refute, nor endorse, these theories; merely, present the evidence." Despite this claim, prophecies are often exaggerated or presented incorrectly. For example, the show repeatedly claims that the Mayan Long Count calendar predicts the end of the world for December 21, 2012 while in reality it marks the first day of the 14th b'ak'tun era and not any belief in the end of the world. The series was described as full of misleading suggestions supported by vague, unattributed weasel phrases such as "some think that", "many believe that", and "scholars suggest that", while in his book "2012: It's Not the End of the World" Nostradamus specialist Peter Lemesurier describes its Nostradamian aspects as 'largely fiction' and lurid nonsense'.

Durris Castle or the House of Dores was an early royal residence on southern bank of the River Dee in Aberdeenshire, Scotland. The castle controlled the northern end of the Crynes Corse Mounth trackway. Dating from at least the 13th century, the castle, a motte and bailey, was occupied by Alexander III and is mentioned in the Chamberlain Rolls of the time as the subject of repairs. King Edward I of England stayed one night in 1296 at the castle, during his invasion of Scotland. Durris was granted to the Fraser family by King Robert I of Scotland and created into a barony by King David II of Scotland. It was burned by the Marquis of Montrose in 1645 and not rebuilt. No remains of the castle exist today, but the 7-metre-high conical knoll on which it stood retains the name "Castle Hill". The hill has a flattened summit measuring 41 metres by 30 metres, and its sides may have been artificially steepened. Evidence remains on the western side of the site of a 2.6 metre ditch, possibly a moat.

Spar and Membrane Structure (SMS) is a type of wall construction in which lightly reinforced 2" - 3" [5 cm - 8 cm] of shotcrete or gunite skins (membranes) are interconnected with extended “X” shaped light rebar (spars) through the interior of the wall. Typically, SMS construction uses straw bales as leave in formwork for the concrete skins with the spars placed at the head of each bale, however, many other types of formwork could be used in place of straw bales. The SMS system was invented and patented by R. Gary Black, an engineer and professor of architecture at the University of California, Berkeley.

Vilho Veikko Päiviö Helanen (24 November 1899 – 8 June 1952) was a Finnish civil servant and politician. Helanen was born in Oulu, and was a student as the University of Helsinki, where he gained an MA in 1923 and completed his doctorate in 1940. From 1924 to 1926 he edited the student paper "Ylioppilaslehti" and around this time joined the Academic Karelia Society. He served as chairman of the group from 1927–8, from 1934-5 and again from 1935–44, helping to turn the Society against democracy. Helanen visited Estonia in 1933 and was amazed at the high levels of popular support for the far right that he witnessed there, in contrast to Finland where it was a more marginal force. As a result, he was involved in the coup attempt of the Vaps Movement in Estonia in 1935. Helanen was a major inspiration for the Patriotic People's Movement and a close friend of Elias Simojoki, although he did not join the group and instead became a vocal supporter of Adolf Hitler. He formed his own group, "Nouseva Suomi", in 1940 which, despite his earlier radicalism, became associated with the mainstream National Progressive Party. Rising to be head of the civil service during the Second World War he was imprisoned after the war for treasonable offences. Following his release he worked for Suomi-Filmi and also wrote a series of detective novels. He died of a heart attack in the railway station at Frankfurt am Main, West Germany. 

The was the highest judicial body in the Empire of Japan. It existed from 1875 to 1947. Organized by the Ministry of Justice in 1875, the Japanese Supreme Court of Judicature was modeled after Court of Cassation in France. The court was composed of 120 judges in both civil and criminal divisions. Five judges would be empaneled for any given case. The criminal division of the court was the court of first instance for crimes against the Emperor (e.g. "lèse majesté") and for high crimes against public order. The promulgation of the Constitution of the Empire of Japan (i.e. the “Meiji Constitution”), confirmed and formalized its position at the apex of the Japanese court system, consisting of the local courts, district courts and court of appeals. It was abolished by order of the American occupation authorities in 1947, after the abolition of the Meiji Constitution. The building of the Supreme Court of Judicature was gutted by American air raids during the bombing of Tokyo in World War II. It was repaired, and continued to be used as the Supreme Court of Japan under the post-war Constitution of Japan until 1974. The present Tokyo High Court was built on its former location.

Josef Mikoláš (, 23 January 1938 – 20 March 2015) was a Czechoslovak ice hockey goaltender of the 1950s and 1960s. His biggest success came in 1961 when he helped the Czechoslovak national ice hockey team win silver medals at the World Ice Hockey Championships in Geneva, Switzerland and in 1963 when they took bronze in Stockholm, Sweden. Altogether he played in 29 matches for the national team. Josef Mikoláš was born to a single mother and had three younger siblings. When he was a small boy, he suffered from several serious illnesses, including pneumonia and rickets. When he was five years old, he still could not walk. Despite this he later attended a coal mining apprentice school in Ostrava and worked as a coal miner after he finished it. He lived in Ostrava and started his ice hockey career here. Josef Mikoláš started playing for ice-hockey team Pracovní zálohy Ostrava in 1956, but soon he came to another Ostrava team, VŽKG Vítkovice, who were playing in the Czechoslovak First Ice Hockey League, the highest league in former Czechoslovakia. He quickly got recognition for both his goaltender's skills and courage with which he faced the shots, although he was not wearing any head protection in that time. In 1959 he was elected the best Czechoslovak goaltender of the season. His career culminated in 1961, when he was nominated into the Czechoslovak national ice hockey team for the World Ice Hockey Championships in Geneva, Switzerland. The team won most of the matches and surprisingly beat even the Soviet Union 6–4. They drew with Canada 1–1 and finally took silver due to Canada's better overall score. For his performance Josef Mikoláš won the trophy of the Czechoslovak Sportsperson of the Year. In 1962 the World Championships took place in Colorado Springs, USA, but the Soviet Union and Czechoslovakia boycotted the tournament. In 1963 they took bronze at the World Championships in Stockholm, Sweden. Josef Mikoláš was acknowledged for his courage, with which he faced the puck although he did not wear face protection. In his time only some goaltenders experimented with home-made masks, but he refused to use any. Throughout his career he lost eight teeth and suffered a broken cheekbone, double fracture of his lower jaw and 35 sutured injuries. As the most painful he described a shot of Karel Gut, which cost him four teeth at one moment. Altogether he had about eighty stitches all over his head. He tried wearing a goaltender mask only a short time before the end of his career. Soon after the World Championships in Sweden Mikoláš's career started declining. In 1965 he got divorced and moved to Chomutov, where he got married again and played for VTŽ Chomutov until 1968. Then he returned to Ostrava but in 1970 he finally finished his ice hockey career and worked as a sports journalist. He had three daughters. On 20 March 2015, he died after an illness. 

The 2004 William & Mary Tribe football team represented the College of William & Mary, United States, in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) Division I-AA (now called Football Championship Subdivision <nowiki>[FCS]</nowiki>) college football during the 2004 season. William & Mary competed as a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference (A-10) under head football coach Jimmye Laycock and played their home games at Zable Stadium. The 2004 Tribe football team is considered, within the William & Mary community, to be one of the two greatest teams ever assembled at the college (the other being the 2009 team). For the first time William & Mary reached the NCAA Division I-AA Semifinals. They set a single season school record for wins (11) and were A-10 Conference Co-Champions after going 7–1 in conference play. Many Tribe players garnered postseason awards and accolades, highlighted by quarterback Lang Campbell's selection as the 2004 Walter Payton Award winner, which is given annually to the most outstanding offensive player in the Division I FCS of college football as chosen by a nationwide panel of media and college sports information directors. William & Mary finished the 2004 season ranked #3 nationally in the final Division I-AA polls. No team in school history had ever finished with a ranking that high, nor had any Tribe squad even reached #3 at any point during any season. The Tribe were not nationally ranked heading into the 2004 season. Coming off of a 5–5 record in 2003 in which they had failed to qualify for the playoffs, national media did not predict much more success for them in 2004. They had lost Rich Musinski to graduation—a wide receiver who graduated as one of three players in NCAA history to collect more than 4,000 receiving yards. Though quarterback Campbell was returning for his redshirt senior season, he was not expected to lead the Tribe to the success they would later achieve. The Tribe began their 2004 campaign by traveling to Chapel Hill, North Carolina to take on the UNC Tar Heels of the Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS). Over 43,500 people went to Kenan Memorial Stadium to see the match-up. Despite holding a 24–14 halftime lead, the Tribe could not hold on for the victory, losing 38–49. After a bye-week, William & Mary resumed their season on September 18 against #10-ranked New Hampshire in Durham. This contest began conference play. The unranked Tribe only mustered three field goals for the match, but it proved to be enough as they came away with a 9–7 win. And, despite the lack of offense, William & Mary held the Wildcats scoreless for the last 50:48 of the game in the come-from-behind victory. Game 3 pitted William & Mary against a lesser VMI Keydets team. They led 28–6 at halftime, and the lead bulged to 35–6 by the end of the third quarter. The Tribe won the non-conference game 42–6. William & Mary plays the Virginia Military Institute nearly every season, and consequently a friendly rivalry has spawned from it. On October 2, the #16-ranked Northeastern Huskies traveled to Williamsburg to face the unranked Tribe. The contest was evenly matched as both teams headed into halftime tied at 14. William & Mary trailed by four points going into the fourth quarter, but a field goal by All-American kicker Greg Kuehn and a receiving touchdown by future National Football League player Dominique Thompson, followed by a successful two-point conversion, provided the Tribe with 11 points in the final period. Northeastern had also scored one touchdown, and the game went to overtime knotted at 35 points apiece. William & Mary's ability to convert a field goal attempt, coupled with their defense holding the Huskies from scoring any points in the extra period, gave the Tribe a 38–35 win at home. It was the second victory over a ranked opponent by unranked William & Mary. William & Mary faced the Liberty Flames in Lynchburg on October 9. The Tribe scored 10 points in each of the first three quarters en route to their second non-conference win of 2004. They scored seven more insurance points in the fourth quarter to finish the game with 37 while Liberty managed only 17 of their own. The contest marked the first time of the 2004 season that William & Mary entered a game ranked in the Top 25 nationally. Heading into the game, the 3–1 Tribe were ranked #18. The Tribe fell behind 7–0 within the first three minutes of the game after the Rams connected on a 52-yard touchdown pass. By the end of the first quarter, however, the Tribe had scored two unanswered touchdowns of their own to take a 14–7 lead. After exchanging field goals in the second quarter, the two teams went into halftime by a score of 17–10. The Rams scored first during the third quarter when they finished their drive with a five-yard touchdown run to tie the game. After William & Mary responded with another touchdown of their own, Rhode Island kept chipping away at the defense and would eventually tie the score at 24. Once again, the Tribe responded. With 8:09 left to play, running back Elijah Brooks powered in for a score from two yards out. Neither team would score again, and William & Mary won 31–24. In a highly anticipated match-up between two ranked teams, the #14 Tribe traveled north to Newark to play #3 Delaware. It only took 2:27 for William & Mary to score first on a 10-yard touchdown pass to Dominique Thompson. The Blue Hens only mustered a three-and-out on their first possession, and, less than one minute after their first touchdown, Lang Campbell once again found Thompson, this time for a 62-yard touchdown pass. At the 6:12 mark of the first quarter, Delaware would finally get on the scoreboard with a touchdown of their own. But as the Blue Hens soon found out, the first quarter belonged to Dominique Thompson, who hauled in his "third" touchdown reception, which was 87 yards, with 4:26 to play. It looked as though William & Mary would win the match in a runaway. A 17–0 shutout of the Tribe in the second quarter quickly squashed that idea, and the teams went into halftime separated by three points. The second half was a much more defensive struggle than the first, as both teams only mustered one touchdown and zero field goals apiece (both in the fourth quarter). A fast William & Mary start would not sustain, and the Blue Hens "upset" the lower-ranked Tribe 31–28. The high intensity of the game foreshadowed another great match-up to come later in the season. Like the previous game against Delaware, William & Mary wide receiver Dominique Thompson burned the opposition in the first quarter. Less than two minutes into the game, Lang Campbell connected with Thompson on a 46-yard touchdown throw. Towson would kick a field goal, but that was all the scoring by either team for the first 15 minutes. The middle two quarters belonged to the Tribe as they scored four touchdowns and a field goal to take a 38–3 lead into the final frame. With their substitutes playing most of the fourth quarter, William & Mary gave up 13 points to the Tigers and only managed three of their own. It did not matter as they would roll to a 41–16 win. On November 6, #19 Villanova traveled to Williamsburg as the #13 Tribe played their fourth ranked opponent of the season. Things did not start well for William & Mary. Wildcat Martin Gibson returned the opening kickoff 95 yards for a quick touchdown. Several minutes later, however, Tribe running back Jon Smith punched in a 1-yard touchdown run of his own. A Greg Kuehn PAT was good and the two teams were tied at seven. In the second quarter, Villanova would take a 14–7 lead at the 12:38 mark on a touchdown pass. William & Mary responded four minutes later to tie the game, but another Villanova touchdown with 3:38 left would make the score 21–14 at halftime in favor of the Wildcats. In the second half, the Tribe would go on to score three unanswered touchdowns and force a safety to take a 37–21 lead. Villanova would not score again until 32 seconds remained, but by then the game was out of reach and William & Mary had earned their seventh win of the season. Unlike the University of Richmond football rivalry, which is specific to one sport, the W&M–JMU athletic rivalry spans across the board to all sports. When the #10 Tribe went to Harrisonburg to play #4 James Madison, both teams were intense from the start. The first quarter was a defensive battle as neither team conceded good field position to the other. It was not until 2:49 was left that the first points were scored—a David Rabil 28-yard field goal for JMU. William & Mary tied the game with a Kuehn field goal in the second quarter, but the Dukes took a 10–3 lead with 3:19 left in the first half on a 17-yard passing touchdown. William & Mary played well in the third quarter, outscoring rival Madison 7–0. In the decisive fourth quarter, the Dukes would score first after punching in a 4-yard touchdown run. After two straight passing touchdowns by Campbell, the Tribe had taken the lead, 24–17. Madison responded to tie the match with only 45 seconds remaining after a successful 27-yard touchdown pass. Once William & Mary received the ball on the ensuing kick-off, they drove 43 yards in five plays to set up a potential game-winning field goal. After a timeout, Tribe kicker Greg Kuehn drilled a 45-yard field goal as time expired, giving William & Mary the upset win. The Tribe team and attending fans swarmed the field as they reveled in their defeat of their archrivals in dramatic fashion. On November 20, the Richmond Spiders came to William & Mary for the 114th all-time meeting between the teams. The winner of the annual contest—dubbed the I-64 Bowl—receives the I-64 Trophy. Prior to kick-off, W&M held the series edge 58–50–5. Regardless of how either team is doing in a particular season, the I-64 Bowl is always a match of pride between schools. The first quarter was relatively fruitless for both teams. The only points came on a 25-yard pass to Thompson from Campbell to cap a 9-play, 80-yard drive. After a Kuehn kick, the Tribe led 7–0. The second quarter was very similar; many plays, few points. Another W&M touchdown and PAT capped the first half scoring. In the third quarter, however, William & Mary blew a quasi-close game wide open. They outscored the Spiders 24–0 to take a 38–0 lead into the final frame. During the third, Adam Bratton caught two touchdown passes, Joe Nicholas caught one and Greg Kuehn finished off the scoring with a field goal. Richmond would not score their first points until 5:37 left in the game when David Freeman ran in a score from 16 yards out. The Spiders would make the final score look more respectable than it was by scoring another touchdown in garbage time on a seven-yard pass with only five seconds remaining. With the win, William & Mary not only secured their 59th all-time I-64 Trophy, but also a clinch of the Atlantic 10 Conference title. As the 6th-ranked team nationally, William & Mary was able to host all of their playoff games (unless a higher-ranked team were to play them). In the opening round, the Tribe hosted the #11 Hampton Pirates. Hampton was able to jump on William & Mary early. Running back Ardell Daniels punched in a 1-yard touchdown score 4:01 into the first quarter to cap a four-play, 51-yard scoring drive. Several series by both teams followed, none of which resulted in any points. The Pirates would score their second touchdown with 3:31 left in the first quarter, but the PAT was blocked and the score remained 13–0. Both teams were evenly matched in the deeply contested match. The second quarter offered little offense. The only points came from the Tribe's 8-yard touchdown pass to Bratton. William & Mary was losing 13–7, in their home stadium, at the half. The second half was a much more offensively-oriented game. The Tribe received the opening kickoff, and less than two minutes later, Campbell found Thompson on a 27-yard touchdown pass. Greg Kuehn made the extra point, and William & Mary was now ahead 14–13. Hampton, however, quickly responded. Jerome Mathis returned the ensuing kickoff 93 yards for the Pirates' third score of the day. They completed a two-point conversion to take a 21–14 lead. There was one more score of the third quarter – a 4-yard run by William & Mary's Jon Smith. The teams headed into the final 15 minutes tied at 21. Hampton once again scored first. Jerome Mathis caught his second touchdown pass when Pirates quarterback Prince Shepherd connected with him for a 43-yard score. Like Hampton had done to them earlier, the Tribe responded by returning the ensuing kickoff 92 yards for a quick score. The game was now knotted at 28 points with fewer than twelve minutes remaining. William & Mary was able to stop Hampton on the next series for a timely defensive effort. The high-scoring Tribe offense then took the field and, like many times before over the course of the season, Lang Campbell found Dominique Thompson for a touchdown pass. This time it came as the first play of scrimmage in a one-play, 45-yard pass that encompassed nine seconds. For the first time all game, William & Mary held a lead of seven points. Hampton was unable to respond. Their next offensive series produced zero points, giving possession back to William & Mary. The Tribe then took advantage of their opportunity. Smith ran in his second touchdown of the contest when he punched in a 4-yard run with only 1:58 remaining. Hampton had no choice but to use a no-huddle, hurry-up offense. They managed to complete an eight-play, 56-yard drive to score on Prince's 7-yard quarterback scurry with 32 seconds remaining. After a successful PAT, the Pirates attempted an onside kick but could not recover it. The Tribe burned the rest of the game clock and walked away with a 42–35 opening round victory—their first playoff win since 1996 when they beat Jacksonville State. The 2004 Division I-AA Quarterfinal match-up against the defending national champion University of Delaware Fightin' Blue Hens was one of the most prolific football games in a long William & Mary history. The Tribe hosted the Blue Hens at Zable Stadium on a cold December 4 afternoon. When the double-overtime game finally ended, the Tribe had accumulated 500 yards of offense while Delaware accounted for 491 of their own. The match was also the largest come-from-behind win in Tribe history after they erased a Blue Hen 21-point fourth-quarter lead to send the game into extra sessions. Delaware opened the contest's scoring with an Omar Cuff 37-yard touchdown run 3:32 into the first quarter. A little over one minute later, Tribe quarterback Lang Campbell (30-of-53, 342 yards, three touchdowns, no interceptions) would find receiver John Pitts for an 11-yard passing score to even the game at seven apiece. Cuff would score during the first quarter once more, however, as the Blue Hens took a 14–7 lead. In the second quarter, Delaware added to their lead and seemingly put the game out of reach by halftime. Blue Hens quarterback Sonny Riccio (24-of-41, 262 yards, three touchdowns, 2 INTs) connected two times for scores with David Boler in addition to a Brad Shushman field goal. William & Mary's only points came from a Greg Kuehn field goal. Delaware outscored William & Mary 17–3 during the period and took a 31–10 lead into halftime. The third quarter was a defensive battle as neither team was able to put any points on the board. The score remained a 21-point deficit for the Tribe at the start of the fourth quarter. William & Mary exploded offensively in the quarter, however, and (with a staunch defensive effort) came back to force overtime at 31–31 by putting up 21 straight points in the frame. Stephen Cason ran back an interception 62 yards for a touchdown 10 seconds into the quarter, Jon Smith scored on a two-yard touchdown run, and Campbell threw a 15-yard scoring pass to Joe Nicholas with just under two minutes to play. The miraculous comeback was not complete as the game headed into overtime. Delaware struck first when Justin Long caught a seven-yard touchdown pass from Riccio for a 38–31 Delaware advantage. The Tribe countered with a two-yard touchdown pass from Nicholas, which knotted the score at 38 apiece and set the stage for Smith's heroics in the second overtime session. Kuehn missed his first extra point of the season after Smith scored, opening the door for a Delaware victory on the ensuing possession. However, William & Mary stopped the Blue Hens on the next possession to steal the six-point win. William & Mary fans stormed Zable Stadium and celebrated on the middle of the field after the game concluded. The win also thrust the Tribe into their first-ever national semifinal playoff game, which was to be against their biggest rival, James Madison University. For the first time since the 1930s, William & Mary hosted a night-time football game. Using temporary stadium lights to illuminate the field and stands, the sold-out Division I-AA semifinal against James Madison was broadcast live on the ESPN2 television network. The Tribe had a six-game winning streak heading into the contest, and the Dukes had only two losses all season—one early season loss to Division I-A power West Virginia, and the other to William & Mary on a last second field goal. Whereas the Tribe won their first two playoff games at home, James Madison was forced to win both of theirs on the road. In the game's early going, all momentum and big plays were going Madison's way. They trounced William & Mary in the first quarter and went up 21–0 by virtue of rushing, passing and interception touchdowns. The game seemed out of reach for the Tribe before a blink of an eye. However, as quickly as the Dukes gained a lead, they gave it right back. In the second quarter, Greg Kuehn got the Tribe's scoring started 1:22 in with a 27-yard field goal. After a defensive stop forced Madison to punt, William & Mary went on a 68-yard, 4:41 drive to score their first touchdown (a two-yard Lang Campbell run). Another empty possession for the Dukes gave the Tribe new life as they took advantage and scored another touchdown with 2:14 remaining in the half to cut the deficit to four. After forcing a third straight punt, William & Mary capitalized for a fourth time in the second quarter as Kuehn made a 42-yard field goal as time expired in the first half. After being down 21–0 after one quarter, William & Mary crawled back to nearly even the score at 21–20. The Tribe continued their scoring in the third quarter when Campbell found Dominique Thompson for a seven-yard touchdown pass 3:23 into the half. They took their first lead of the game, 27–21. Less than one minute later, however, the Dukes responded with a two-play, 63-yard drive capped by a touchdown pass to D. D. Boxley from quarterback Justin Rascati. On William & Mary's next three possessions, they lost two fumbles and were forced to punt, giving the ball back to JMU each time. The Dukes took advantage of two of those possessions by scoring one rushing and one passing touchdown to take a 41–26 lead into the final frame. In the fourth quarter, Madison scored an insurance touchdown with 8:01 remaining when Alvin Banks punched in a one-yard run. The Tribe would not score again until a four-yard Campbell hook-up with John Pitts with 1:21 remaining in the game. In a game of runs, James Madison University would prevail to move on to the 2004 Division I-AA National Championship that they would later win, becoming the first time in history to win a national championship by defeating every team on the road. With the loss, William & Mary's record-breaking season ended, but myriad individual and team accolades were still to come.

Lava Lake Land & Livestock is a lamb producer located between the Pioneer Mountains and Craters of the Moon National Monument and Preserve in South Central Idaho. The ranch consists of of private land and over of lands administered by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM), United States Forest Service, National Park Service, and the Idaho Department of Lands. Lava Lake Ranch was founded in 1999 with the purchase and consolidation of six historic sheep and cattle ranches. Brian and Kathleen Bean, the new owners, purchased these properties with the intention of producing and marketing certified organic and all-natural lamb while protecting the natural characteristics of the landscape. Their conservation efforts started with the donation of a conservation easement to the Nature Conservancy. Since that time Lava Lake has created a non-profit organization, the Lava Lake Institute for Science and Conservation to undertake conservation research. All of the lambs raised at Lava Lake are free range and grass-fed throughout their lives. Herders trail the sheep from the Snake River Plain of Southern Idaho north into the Pioneer and Boulder Mountains in Central Idaho, following the seasons. The lamb produced by Lava Lake has been featured in Sunset Magazine, the San Francisco Chronicle, and the New York Times Lava Lake Ranch markets their lamb primarily through their website. They are a producer member of Idaho's Bounty, a food cooperative for Central Idaho. Lava Lake Lamb can also be found in a number of restaurants in the northern Rockies. Lava Lake's grazing method is based on a rigorous scientific analysis of grazing capability and capacity and an assessment of wildlife habitat needs that was conducted in partnership with the Nature Conservancy. Management practices include: Lava Lake has collaborated with a number of organizations to accomplish conservation goals in the Pioneers-Craters of the Moon landscape. They are a founding member of the Pioneer's Alliance, a coalition of ranchers, conservationist, scientists, elected and agency officials, recreationsist, and local residents. The goal of this collaboration is the preserving of the landscape where Lava Lake operates. Lava Lake has also been influential in developing a strategy for the coexistence with predators. They are a member of the Wood River Wolf Project. In an ongoing effort to avoid conflict with wolves, Lava Lake Ranch, with assistance from Defenders of Wildlife, have equipped herders with radio telemetry receivers, electrified night enclosures, increased night watch, and non-lethal deterrents. The Lava Lake Institute has also conducted extensive field research on habitat and migration over the landscape where the ranch's sheep graze. Ongoing research is occurring on the migration patterns of Pronghorn. The research conducted by Lava Lake and collaborating organizations has been incorporated into the Freedom to Roam Campaign being organized by Patagonia. Lava Lake has received a number awards for their work on conservation and grazing management. These awards include:

The Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge on the island of Kauai in Hawaii. It is located within the Hanalei River Valley along the island's northern shore. The Refuge was established on 30 November 1972 for the conservation of endangered plants and animals, especially the Hawaiian stilt, Hawaiian coot, Hawaiian gallinule and Hawaiian duck. The Refuge is a relatively flat river valley ranging from above sea level and is surrounded by steep wooded hillsides up to high. The average annual temperature is approximately , and annual rainfall usually exceeds . At the southeastern end of the Refuge, water from the Hanalei River is diverted into an east and west supply ditch. It then flows northwest and irrigates approximately of taro and of wildlife impoundments before returning to the river. The Refuge encompasses a total area of approximately . The Refuge hosts five endangered waterbirds, the "āeo" (Hawaiian stilt, "Himantopus mexicanus knudseni"), "alae kea" (Hawaiian coot, "Fulica alai"), alae ula (Hawaiian moorhean, "Gallinula chloropus sandvicensis"), koloa maoli (Hawaiian duck, "Anas wyvilliana"), and nēnē (Hawaiian goose, "Branta sandvicensis"), as well as 18 other introduced bird species. Refuge wetlands are closed to the public to protect the endangered waterbirds and taro crops. Limited access is allowed along a county river road. There are interpretive panels located at the Hanalei Valley overlook, across from the Princeville Shopping Center. A new overlook/visitor center is planned for an area adjacent to the refuge near the existing rudimentary overlook. Hanalei National Wildlife Refuge includes the Hoopulapula Haraguchi Rice Mill, which is on the National Register of Historic Places. A nonprofit association conducts historic and environmental education activities for local school groups and visitors under a Special Use Permit.

Bruno Aleksander Salmiala (24 August 1890 in Gävle, Sweden as Bruno Sundström – 4 September 1981 in Helsinki) was a Finnish legal theorist and a far-right politician. Salmiala completed his PhD in jurisprudence at the University of Helsinki in 1924 and became a career academic, serving as a professor of criminal law at the institution from 1925 to 1959. He worked as the secretary of the Finnish Bar Association from 1920 to 1957 and was the executive editor of the legal journal "Defensor Legis" for 48 years (1920–1968). Salmiala also had an extensive career in the civil service, first as the deputy Parliamentary Ombudsman (1924–1928), then as a prosecutor (1926–1930) and finally as the head of the Criminal law institute (1955–1959). Salmiala's first involvement in politics came in 1928 when he was appointed to the board of directors of "Uusi Suomi", the organ of the conservative National Coalition Party. However his opinions shifted to the right and in 1932 he joined the Academic Karelia Society and became a founder member of the Patriotic People's Movement (IKL). He was appointed deputy leader in charge of organisation in the latter movement. An opponent of the violent tactics sometimes employed by the IKL due to his legal background he was nonetheless ideologically radical in contrast to the more conservative likes of Herman Gummerus and Erkki Räikkönen. He also represented Häme Province in the Parliament of Finland for the IKL from 1933 to 1944. Additionally, Salmiala served as an elected member of the Helsinki city council. Salmiala dropped out of politics after the Second World War and, as well as continuing his academic work, was a member of the Finnish Radio and Television Committee. He lived to the age 91. 

"The Reeling" is a song by American electronic band Passion Pit. It was released on May 11, 2009, as the first single from the band's debut studio album, "Manners". The song features background vocals from the PS22 Chorus. Generally well received by music critics, the single entered the "Billboard" Alternative Songs chart in September 2009. In the United Kingdom, the single originally peaked at number 137, but was re-issued in January 2010, where it performed slightly better at number 99. With this improved showing, the record company then re-issued "Sleepyhead" in March 2010. The song was featured on soccer video game "Pro Evolution Soccer 2011". A music video for the song premiered in April 2009. It depicts a carefree night on the town and uses ripped-paper visual effects. A remixed version of "The Reeling" was used on the trailer for the fourth season of the British TV series "Skins". Lou Thomas of the BBC praised the song's vocals and beats, and called it "unquestionably one of the greatest songs of 2009." Emily Kendrick of "This Is Fake DIY" noted the song's exuberance and compared it vocally to the Bee Gees. Louise Brailey of "NME" said the song's opening "sounds weirdly like an old-school hardcore breakdown, before collapsing into starry disco-pop." Mike Diver of "Clash" magazine said the song "combine[s] elements of the purest pop with compositional playfulness." Matthew Cole of "Slant Magazine" credits the song's ability, along with album track "Moth's Wings," to combine decades worth of "party music" genres, including disco, house, rave, and 1980s rock. Zach Kelly of Pitchfork Media described the song as sweet and earnest, adding that listeners "won't remember it the next morning, but it probably earned a grin the night before." Andrzej Lukowski of Drowned in Sound called the song "quite annoying," though he gave the album a favorable review overall. 

Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin, 1st Baronet (16 May 1759 – 23 July 1839) was an officer of the Royal Navy who served during the American War of Independence and the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Coffin was born in Boston and served in the navy on a number of ships during the War of Independence. He fought at Cape Henry with Arbuthnot and at St. Kitts with Hood, eventually being promoted to command a number of small ships on the American coast. Despite his rise through the ranks, he clashed occasionally with the naval hierarchy, with the first incident occurring while still a newly commissioned commander aboard . An incident over unqualified lieutenants led to his court-martial, though he was acquitted. A more serious incident occurred after the end of the war with America, when Coffin was particularly active off the Canadian coast. A charge was brought of issuing false musters, and though the practice was endemic in the navy, led to his dismissal from the ship. The First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Howe, then intervened to have him dismissed from the navy entirely, a decision that was later overturned by an inquiry, which set an important precedent. Restored to his rank, Coffin commanded several ships during the opening years of the wars with France, but the recurrence of an old injury forced him to move ashore. He spent the rest of the war commanding a number of dockyards, continuing to rise through the ranks, and being created a baronet for his good service. Retiring from active naval service towards the end of the Napoleonic Wars Coffin briefly changed his surname to Coffin-Greenly before reverting it, entered politics, and died with the rank of admiral in 1839. Isaac Coffin was born in Boston, Massachusetts on 16 May 1759, into what would prove to be a strong loyalist family. He was the fourth and youngest son of the paymaster of the customs in the port, Nathaniel Coffin. His father descended from Tristram Coffin, who immigrated to Massachusetts from Devon in 1642. His mother was Elizabeth, the daughter of the merchant Henry Barnes, of Boston. He attended the Boston Latin School. He first appeared on the books of the 74-gun as an able seaman in October 1771, while "Captain" was at Boston under the command of Captain Thomas Symonds, and is recorded as having transferred to the brig under Lieutenant William Hunter at Rhode Island in May 1773. However it is more likely that he did not enter the service until October 1773, joining George Montagu, captain of . Montagu was the son of Rear-Admiral John Montagu, then commander in chief on the North American station. He later followed George Montagu aboard . Coffin was commissioned lieutenant on 18 August 1776 while serving aboard the brig under Lieutenant Edmund Dod at Halifax, but was not able to take up the rank immediately. Instead he joined the 50-gun as a midshipman in September 1776, the "Romney" then being at Newfoundland. In June 1778 he moved aboard the 50-gun , still as a midshipman. He finally received a posting as a lieutenant in October 1778, aboard the cutter . He briefly served as a volunteer aboard Captain Thomas Pasley's ship , and from there moved in June 1779 to the armed ship "Pincon", serving on the Labrador coast. The "Pincon" was wrecked in August 1779, and in November he was moved aboard the 50-gun under Captain Gideon Johnstone as her second lieutenant. The "Adamant" was then being completed at Liverpool, with Coffin helping to oversee work. He was involved in a number of accidents during the final phases of work, but was able to get her ready to sail to Plymouth under a jury-rig by June 1780. He went out with "Adamant" to North America the following month as a convoy escort, and in February 1781 transferred to the 90-gun , flagship of Rear-Admiral Sir Thomas Graves. Coffin's time aboard "London" was brief, and in March he moved aboard the 74-gun , under Captain Swiney. "Royal Oak" was the flagship of Vice-Admiral Mariot Arbuthnot at the Battle of Cape Henry on 16 March, and Coffin acted as Arbuthnot's signal lieutenant. "Royal Oak" then returned to New York, but ran aground while passing from the North to the East River, and was badly damaged. She had to sail to Halifax for repairs, after which Arbuthnot returned to England. "Royal Oak" set sail to return New York in July, joining the fleet, now under Admiral Graves, on her journey. Here Coffin received news of his promotion to master and commander on 3 July, and on arriving in New York, took command of the sloop HMS "Avenger". He was initially based in the North River, but in December he exchanged ships with Alexander Cochrane and took command of the 14-gun sloop "Pacahunter". While aboard "Pacahunter" he was present during a great fire in St. John's, and helped to fight it, a service that earned him the thanks of the House of Assembly. His service aboard her was shortlived, for he and the entire ship's company volunteered to join Rear-Admiral Samuel Hood's flagship, the 90-gun . Coffin was present at Hood's attack on the French fleet under the Comte de Grasse at Basseterre, the Battle of St. Kitts, on 25 January 1782. Coffin then went on to Antigua to join his ship, travelling aboard Captain Hugh Cloberry Christian's , and in company with a frigate under Captain Henry Harvey. During the voyage the two ships ran into the French ship of the line "Triomphant" and the frigate "Braave". The French fired upon the smaller British ships, but the latter were able to escape and arrived safely at St. John's. Coffin then went on to Jamaica where his friendship with Hood led to his promotion to post-captain on 13 June 1782 and an appointment to command the 74-gun . It was while commanding "Shrewsbury" at Jamaica that Coffin had the first of a number of run-ins with naval authority that was to mark his career. The commander of the fleet, Admiral George Brydges Rodney, ordered Coffin to take three lieutenants with insufficient sea time. Coffin refused, apparently unaware that the order had come from Rodney himself, arguing that as the boys had respectively only five, three and two years service, they were unqualified to serve as lieutenants. On learning that it was Rodney's express wish that the boys be taken on as lieutenants, Coffin grudgingly acceded, but Rodney came to hear of Coffin's initial refusal, and had him court-martialed on charges of disobedience and contempt. The trial was held at Port Royal on 29 July, with Coffin being acquitted of both charges, the court determining that 'the appointment of these officers by commission was irregular and contrary to the established rules of the service.' Despite the verdict, the court did not have the power to suspend appointments made by the commander in chief, and Coffin was forced to write to the Admiralty on 20 September 1782, requesting the lieutenants' commissions be suspended. The Admiralty issued the recall of the commissions on 14 December, by which time Coffin had moved from "Shrewsbury" to take command of the 20-gun . Coffin sailed "Hydra" back to England and paid her off in March 1783. Coffin was left temporarily unemployed after the end of the American War of Independence, and spent some of his time in France, where he studied the French language. He returned to service in May 1786 with an appointment to command the 28-gun . He was ordered to transport Lord Dorchester and his family to Quebec, and departed the Scilly Isles for the voyage across the Atlantic on 9 September. He arrived at the Gulf of Saint Lawrence on 10 October, and anchored at Quebec on 23 October. Coffin sailed for Halifax two days after arriving, reaching the port on 9 November, and spending the winter there. In 1787 he moved to operate in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence and took a particular interest in the Magdalen Islands. He warned the governor's council that New Englanders were exploiting the fisheries in the gulf and were trading illegally with the inhabitants of the islands. Coffin, an American loyalist who had been deprived of his patrimony by the outcome of the War of Independence, was granted the islands in 1798 for his good service. His attempts to attract settlers or evict the squatters who had arrived from Saint Pierre and Miquelon were however unsuccessful. In an effort to exercise authority on his property Coffin had 1 Penny tokens made at Birmingham, England in 1815. The British government felt this was overstepping his authority and revoked his grant of the island. His long association with his estates in Canada, and his business there led to one of his obituaries noting that by the time of his death 'he had crossed the Atlantic, on service or pleasure, no less than thirty times.' While at Halifax with "Thisbe", Coffin entered four boys, including two of Lord Dorchester's sons, onto the ship's books as captain's servants. The boys did not serve on the ship, and were probably still at school. Though technically prohibited, the practice of entering boys onto ships' books as a means of giving them false sea time, was widespread throughout the service, and many naval officers began their careers in this manner. Coffin was accused of knowingly signing false musters, and brought to trial by court-martial. The charge was maliciously motivated, but the court was compelled to examine the evidence. Coffin was tried aboard and the offence was proven. The offence technically required the defendant to be dismissed from the service, but considering the mitigating circumstances, the malicious nature of the charge and the fact that the practice was common in the navy, the court merely sentenced him to be dismissed from his ship. Coffin returned to Britain, whereupon the sentence came to the attention of the First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Howe, who insisted that the full punishment required by the 31st Article of War be carried out. Coffin was duly dismissed from the navy, though he lodged an appeal against the decision. In the meantime Coffin emigrated to Flanders and travelled as a mercenary throughout Denmark, Sweden and Russia, in search of a commission. Meanwhile Coffin's case was considered by the judges of the admiralty, on the question of whether the Admiralty had the right to set aside the judgement of a court-martial. After considering the case, they recorded that though the judgement reached in the original court-martial had not been legal, ' ... the punishment directed to be inflicted ... upon persons convicted of the offence specified in the 31st Article of War ... cannot be inflicted, or judgement thereupon be pronounced, or supplied by any other authority than that of the Court Martial which tried the offender.' In other words, Howe's decision to overrule the sentence imposed by the original court-martial was ruled invalid, and Coffin was reinstated in the service, with the payment of arrears in his wages. The judgement defined the limits of Admiralty interference with courts-martial, and became a frequently cited precedent. Coffin returned to active service during the Spanish Armament, taking command of the sixth rate in 1790. At one point "Alligator" was anchored at the Nore when one of her sailors fell overboard. Coffin jumped into the water to rescue him, and succeeded in recovering the man before he drowned. Coffin experienced a serious rupture while carrying out the rescue, that would dog him in later life. From the Nore he moved to Spithead, and then to Ceuta, where "Alligator" briefly carried the flag of Admiral Philip Cosby. Superseded by the arrival of , "Alligator" was sent to cruise off Western Ireland. In 1792 Coffin returned to Canada, this time to bring Lord Dorchester home. "Alligator" was then paid off, and Coffin, finding himself temporarily unemployed, took the opportunity to tour parts of the continent. The outbreak of the French Revolutionary Wars in 1793 led to Coffin returning to service in command of the 36-gun . He was initially ordered to take Lord Dorchester back to Canada, but the order was later cancelled, and Coffin was compelled to transfer most of his crew to , and then re-man "Melampus". Having done so, he transported armaments and stores to Guernsey in preparation for the expedition under the Earl of Moira. He was then assigned to operate in the English Channel, departing Spithead in company with to join Sir James Wallace. While sailing down the Channel the two British ships encountered a French squadron consisted of five frigates, a corvette and a cutter. The British ships were able to outmanoeuvre the French, and escaped. It was about this time that Coffin began to feel the effects of his rupture, and after over-exerting himself one night, was taken seriously ill and obliged to quit his ship. For the next four months he was virtually crippled, and never again had a seagoing command. Coffin was appointed regulating captain at Leith in Spring 1795, and in October that year took up the post of resident commissioner of the navy at Corsica. His business took him at times to Naples, Florence and Leghorn, and after the British evacuation of the island in 1796 he went from Elba to Lisbon, where he remained for two years. Coffin was next appointed to serve as the Navy Boards resident navy commissioner at Port Mahon Dockyard, Menorca in 1798, followed by the offer of the post at Sheerness. He went out to Halifax Dockyard as its resident commissioner for six months prior to returning and taking up the post of Resident Commissioner of the Navy at Sheerness Dockyard. Both here and at Halifax Coffin seems to have acted under the belief, strongly expressed at the time by Admiral the Earl of St Vincent, that the yard officers were corrupt. Jervis was a strong proponent of the reform of the civil administration of the navy, and Coffin acted to forcefully impose Admiralty regulations. In this he was perhaps influenced by his own experiences with Admiralty law and the rigid hierarchy within the navy, but managed to undermine the efficiency of the dockyards with his overzealous application of the regulations. He was heavily criticised at a local level, but retained Jervis's confidence, and was promoted to rear-admiral on 23 April 1804. He so upset the dock workers that a threatening letter was sent after he ordered a worker to be pressed into the navy for insolence, eventually forcing him to reverse his decision. His reputation as an effective and energetic commissioner earned him the honour of being created a baronet "of the Magdelaine Islands in the Gulph of St. Lawrence, British North America" on 19 May that year, which was followed by being created admiral-superintendent at Portsmouth Dockyard. He remained at Portsmouth until being promoted to vice-admiral on 28 April 1808, at which point he retired. Coffin started a family during his retirement, marrying Elizabeth Browne at Titley on 3 April 1811. Elizabeth was the heiress of William Greenly, and Isaac briefly changed his surname to Coffin-Greenly on 11 February 1811, but reverted to Coffin on 13 March 1813. He was advanced to full admiral on 4 June 1814 and entered politics, being elected as Member of Parliament for Ilchester in 1818, and holding the seat until 1826. Greville recorded the result of one Parliamentary debate soon after his election: The Opposition were very angry with Sir I.Coffin, who, with the candour of a novice, had made himself informed of the facts of the petition, and finding they were against his friends, said so in the House. Coffin was created a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Guelphic Order in 1832. He was a personal friend of Lord Nelson, at whose 1805 funeral he was a pallbearer. He was also a friend of the Duke of Clarence (later William IV), and during the 1832 reform crisis was placed on the King's private list of those to be made peers. However, several Government ministers opposed his appointment on the grounds of his close association with his American relatives, and his name was dropped from the list. Coffin was a noted patron of charities, and a few weeks before his death donated a hundred pounds to the Royal Naval Charity, with the note that he did so 'fearful I might suddenly slip my wind, and in the hurry of my departure forget to order ... £100 to be set aside'. Elizabeth Coffin died on 27 January 1839, with Admiral Sir Isaac Coffin dying six months later on 23 July 1839, at the age of 80. He was buried at Cheltenham, Gloucestershire. As he had no sons, the baronetcy became extinct upon his death. Coffin Bay and Greenly Island in South Australia were named in honor of Sir Isaac Coffin by the British explorer Matthew Flinders in 1802. 

Oahu Forest National Wildlife Refuge was established in 2000 to protect fish, wildlife, and plants which are listed as threatened or endangered species. The refuge encompasses approximately and is managed by the U.S. Fish & Wildlife Service. The Refuge is located on the upper slopes of the northern Koʻolau Range, on the island of O'ahu. O'ahu Forest National Wildlife Refuge is home to at least four species of endangered "pupu kani oe" (O'ahu tree snails), 15 endangered plant species, and many native birds, including the O'ahu "'elepaio, 'i'iwi, pueo", and native honeycreepers. The Refuge is closed to the public. 

Atlantic Storm was a ministerial exercise simulating the top-level response to a bioterror incident. The simulation operated on January 14, 2005 in Washington, D.C. It was created in part to reveal the current international state of preparedness and possible political and public health issues that might evolve from such a crisis. The project was sponsored by the Alfred P. Sloan Foundation, the German Marshall Fund of the United States, and the Nuclear Threat Initiative. Organization efforts were provided by the Center for Biosecurity of UPMC, the Center for Transatlantic Relations of Johns Hopkins University, and the Transatlantic Biosecurity Network. In the scenario, smallpox was released in the following major cities in a covert attack: Istanbul, Rotterdam, Warsaw, Frankfurt, New York City, and Los Angeles. Cases were initially reported in Germany, Turkey, Sweden, and the Netherlands, but the pathogen was exported to other nations within hours. Specifically, the 51 cases confirmed in these four nations grew to 3,320 cases with transatlantic spread after no more than 4.5 hours. This rapid spread of disease forced the attending representatives to grapple with a quickly escalating crisis and revealed difficult tensions between domestic politics and international relations, revealing the need for improving response systems for such a crisis. The scenario was propelled by continual briefings by “Summit Staff”, breaking news segments from the “Global News Network”, and private updates for representatives from their “national advisors”. The scenario assumes that the viral ingredients were obtained from a bioweapons facility in Russia. The terrorist group responsible used publicly available knowledge as well as training in US and Indian universities in order to create the strain of smallpox. To spread the virus, members walked around public areas with canisters releasing the virus in high traffic areas. The initial problem facing the participants was whether to use a ring vaccination strategy over a mass vaccination one in order to deal with the small number of those thought to be infected with the smallpox virus. While ring vaccination is recommended for initial control over an outbreak, states may quickly choose to switch to mass vaccination if it is unsuccessful. In addition, the participants for countries with no infected persons faced pressures to share available vaccine resources with countries currently experiencing outbreaks. As more countries began to experience outbreaks, domestic pressures forced participants to withhold the sharing of vaccines in order to preserve their supply for their own citizens. Other strategies, such as vaccine dilution, became necessary as the amount of those suspected to be infected grew. Participants also considered the viability of closing borders to prevent the further spread of the outbreak to their own countries. Certain dire measures, such as the use of military quarantines, were considered as participants also had the obligation to ensure public safety in civilian populations. Conclusions from the exercise's published documents: At the end of the exercise, participants were given an opportunity to share insights gained during the scenario. The lack of current international strategy and planning represented a shortfall in bioterrorism protection. In addition, members with defense backgrounds warned against the widespread unawareness that bioterrorism presented to safety at home and abroad. They believed that states without adequate protection would pose a dangerous threat to neighboring states with sufficient resources and infrastructure. Atlantic Storm highlights the importance of international communication and coordination in responding to a bioterrorist attack. Participants of the exercise indicated that the WHO would be the ideal entity to coordinate an international response. In addition, Atlantic Storm proved that most countries lack the structure and resources to handle such an outbreak. Therefore, the establishment of more resources and infrastructure is a necessity for the success of future response. Next, entities like the EU and NATO should further develop plans of action for bioterror incidents. Strong international coalitions would ensure that response time in an epidemic is not slowed by complications between neighboring countries. Additionally, many politicians are unaware of the threat of bioterrorism and require more information regarding safety and defense implications. Inclusion of knowledgeable defense authorities and scientists would give politicians the capability to form a response. Finally, the international community should do more, as a whole, to bolster developing countries' resources for defending against epidemics. Below are further exercises by other organizations with similar scenarios: Some observers raised concerns about the exercise how it was conducted. At the time, the World Health Organization, whom participants indicated to be the ideal response coordinator, lacked the resources and staffing to handle the effort. Finally, leaders in today's world need to possess experience in homeland security and bioterrorist threats in order to handle a situation similar to the scenario proposed in Atlantic Storm. The credentials of some participating members were questioned due to a lack of experience in these fields. The rate of infection transmission used by the Atlantic storm exercise was higher than historical records of smallpox transmission. As a result, most otherwise appropriate measures would still fail in the hypothetical scenario. This raises some concerns with conclusions of Atlantic Storm and its application to a real world scenario. In addition, some defense research questions the ability of terrorists to create and distribute such a virus.

The bifurcated needle is a narrow steel rod, approximately long with two prongs at one end. It was designed to hold one dose of reconstituted freeze-dried smallpox vaccine between its prongs. Up to one hundred vaccinations can be given from one vial of the reconstituted vaccine. The established technique is to dip the needle in the vaccine, and then puncture a person's upper arm fifteen times rapidly in a small circular area, without prior cleansing of the skin with alcohol. The needle is then disposed of. When done correctly a trace of blood appears at the vaccination site. The bifurcated needle was created as a more efficient and cost effective alternative to the jet injector previously in use. It was invented in 1965 by Dr. Benjamin Rubin, working at Wyeth Laboratories, and was the primary instrument used during the World Health Organization's 1966–1977 campaign to eradicate smallpox. Rubin estimated that it was used to administer 200 million vaccinations per year during the final years of the campaign. After the September 11, 2001 attacks and subsequent anthrax scares, the US government ordered the smallpox vaccine be available for every person in the country. Precision Medical Products, Inc. was awarded the contract to make the bifurcated needles to go along with the vaccine and made over 400,000,000 of these needles in a two year span. Roechling Medical Lancaster, LLC, who purchased Precision Medical Products in 2018, remains the world's primary supplier of bifurcated needles. 

Captain Joseph Eskel Hallonquist (13 April 1895 - 22 August 1958) was a World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories. When World War I began, Hallonquist was chief clerk of a bank in British Columbia. He joined the 19th Reserve Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force, only to transfer to the Royal Flying Corps. He trained with 26 and 73 Squadrons before being posted on 23 January 1918 to 28 Squadron in Italy as an Honorary Captain. He opened his victory roll on 17 April 1918. His fourth confirmed win on 13 July downed Austro-Hungarian ace Ferdinand Udvardy; although Hallonquist was credited with a destruction, Udvardy survived. On 29 October 1918, Hallonquist was shot down by anti-aircraft fire. He spent a short period as a prisoner of war before returning to Canada.

The Pearl Harbor National Wildlife Refuge is a National Wildlife Refuge on the island of Oahu, Hawaii. It was created in 1972 to mitigate the wildlife resource disturbances caused by construction of the Honolulu International Airport Reef Runway. The Refuge includes three units, the Honouliuli, Waiwa and Kalaeloa. The Honouliuli and Waiawa Units are managed under a cooperative agreement with the United States Navy. The Kalaeloa Unit was established during Base Realignment and Closure proceedings in 2001. Through these cooperative efforts with the Federal Aviation Administration, the State of Hawaii, and the U.S. Navy, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service made Pearl Harbor NWR a reality. The Honouliuli Unit contains two freshwater wetland impoundments that are intensively managed to provide habitat for a variety of waterbirds, including Hawaii's endangered waterbirds and migrant waterfowl. These two impoundments contain nesting islands, aquatic vegetation and mudflats that are used as nesting and foraging areas by various waterbird species throughout the year. The Waiawa Unit is composed of two brackish ponds, one of which is primarily managed for the endangered aeo (a subspecies of the common black-winged stilt, "Himantopus mexicanus knudseni"). However, the pond’s estuarine environment is ideal for establishing a host of food resources for four endangered waterbird species found there. The Kalaeloa Unit, once part of the former Barbers Point Naval Air Station, was added to the Pearl Harbor NWR to protect the endangered Ewa Hinahina ("Achyranthes spledens" var. "rotundata") and ʻAkoko (Euphorbia skottsbergii). This area of raised limestone coral reef contains the last remaining ancient coastal dry shrubland plant communities that were once widespread throughout the Ewa Plain. It is also home to anchialine pools, which are pools of saltwater connected to the ocean via minute cracks in the limestone. These are home to the ōpaeula (Hawaiian shrimp, "Halocaridina rubra"). Native coastal plants still flourish at Kalaeloa amongst two endangered plant species. The largest population of Akoko ("Euphorbia skottsbergii") on Oahu and the second largest population of endangered Ewa Hinahina can be found within this unit. Native plants include the night-blooming Maiapilo ("Capparis sandwichiana") with its beautiful fragrant flowers; the Hinahina, a very dense, soft, and silky-looking plant; and Naio ("Myoporum sandwicense"), one of the few natives that is a strong competitor against alien grasses. To protect the delicate habitats, the refuge is closed to visitors.

Wao Kele O Puna (Wao Kele) is Hawaii's largest remaining lowland wet forest, about south of the city of Hilo, along the East Rift Zone of Kīlauea volcano on the Island of Hawaii. The name means the "upland rainforest of Puna". Puna is one of 9 districts on the island. Lava from Kīlauea continues to flow onto forest land. In 2006, the Trust for Public Land (TPL) purchased Wao Kele, ending a twenty-year struggle to prevent tapping the sizeable geothermal energy resources that lie below it. Opponents believe that the area is the home of the fire goddess Pele. It is also known as the Puna Forest Reserve, located just east of the Puu Ōō vent. The state of Hawaii owned Wao Kele until 1986, when the then Campbell Estate exchanged Kahaualea, an adjacent forest parcel, for it at the state's request. Campbell Estate was a private, for-profit trust set up for the heirs of Scottish-Irish carpenter James Campbell, established in 1900 and dissolved in 2007. Campbell bought more than of Hawaii land before his death. Environmentalists proposed the trade because they considered Kahaualea to be in better condition than Wao Kele. The Pele Defense Fund, however, sued, arguing that privatizing Wao Kele would end traditional hunting and gathering by native Hawaiians. The suit led to a controversial Hawaii State Supreme Court ruling that granted natives access to such private property. In the 2006 transaction, TPL paid $3.65 million for Wao Kele, $131/acre, using $3.4 million in U.S. Forest Service Forest Legacy program money, along with $250,000 from the Office of Hawaiian Affairs (OHA). TPL then transferred title to OHA. On 28 August 2007 OHA took formal ownership of Wao Kele. The office of Hawaiian Affairs acquired Wao Kele o Puna, in order to protect its natural and cultural resources as well as the traditional and customary rights of Native Hawaiians accessing the property. The Hawaii Department of Land and Natural Resources' Division of Forestry and Wildlife is responsible for managing the land until 2017. Wao Kele is licensed for geothermal energy development until 31 January 2016. As of 2009, Hawaii uses the permit only to monitor two existing geothermal wells. OHA has no plans for further development. The Hawaii Legislature has provided $2 million to plug the existing TrueMid-Pacific well with sand and concrete in 2009. The state of Hawaii has substantial geothermal resources, which could dramatically reduce fossil fuel use and energy prices there if the energy can be extracted without damage to the surrounding environment and in accordance with Hawaiian law and culture. Geologists estimate that the Big Island alone has the potential to generate 500–700 megawatts of electricity. Wao Kele came to the attention of geothermal developers after other private sites became inundated with fresh lava from Kīlauea, at depths ranging up to . Developers claim that 100 megawatts of power could be generated from only 300 of the forest's nearly , enough to provide all the electricity for the island's 175,000 residents. Opponents cite the numerous health and safety problems experienced by an experimental state-run plant that closed in 1989, notably including toxic hydrogen sulfide gas emissions. A separate plant (Puna Geothermal Venture) went online in 1993 in Puna's Lower East Rift Zone and continued to generate 25–30 megawatts of electricity The natural increase in hydrogen sulfide and volcanic ash emissions due to volcanic activity within the Kilauea caldera at times produces sufficient vog to affect breathing on the nearby island of Maui. until it was closed in May 2018 due to intrusion of lava from the 2018 lower Puna eruption. At , Wao Kele is Hawaii's largest lowland wet forest. It is home to numerous primary and rare plant species including hāpuu ferns ("Cibotium" spp.), ie vines ("Freycinetia arborea"), and kōpiko ("Psychotria mariniana"), some of which help to limit invasive species' incursions. Opeapea (Hawaiian hoary bat, "Lasiurus cinereus semotus") io (Hawaiian hawk, "Buteo solitarius"), common amakihi ("Hemignathus virens"), and nananana makakii (happy-face spider, "Theridion grallator") live in the trees. There are thought to be many more as-yet-undocumented species within the forest. Wao Kele's primary forest tree is ōhia lehua ("Metrosideros polymorpha"). Wao Kele occupies approximately one-fifth of the watershed that feeds the Pahoa aquifer. The Wao Kele o Puna Reserve is threatened by a number of invasive species, including strawberry guava ("Psidium cattleianum"), Molucca albizia ("Falcataria moluccana"), Koster's curse ("Clidemia hirta"), and glory bush ("Tibouchina herbacea"). Albizia occurs widely in the surrounding area, but is limited to a relatively small number of sites within the reserve. Large patches of strawberry guava occur within the reserve. When Pele came to the island of Hawai'i she found that there was another god of fire currently in possession of the territory. ʻAilāʻau was known and feared by all the people residing in the area. His name, 'Ai means "one who eats or devours." Lāʻau means "tree" or "forest", therefore the God of Fire's name translated to devouring forests. Time and time again, he spread his wrath over the southern districts of Hawai'i creating the desolate lava fields. Translation of the account of Pele taking over Kilauea:When Pele came to the island Hawaiʻi, she first stopped at a place called Keahialaka in the district of Puna. From this place she began her inland journey toward the mountains. As she passed on her way there grew within her an intense desire to go at once and see ʻAilāʻau, the god to whom Kılauea belonged, and find a ̄ resting-place with him as the end of her journey. She came up, but ʻAilāʻau was not in his house. Of a truth he had made himself thoroughly lost. He had vanished because he knew that this one coming toward him was Pele. He had seen her toiling down by the sea at Keahialaka. Trembling dread and heavy fear overpowered him. He ran away and was entirely lost. When he came to that pit she laid out the plan for her abiding home, beginning at once to dig up the foundations. She dug day and night and found that this place fulfilled all her desires. Therefore, she fastened herself tight to Hawaiʻi for all time. These are the words in which the legend disposes of this ancient god of volcanic fires. He disappears from Hawaiian thought and Pele from a foreign land finds a satisfactory crater in which her spirit power can always dig up everlastingly overflowing fountains of raging lava. 

Adult Contemporary is a chart published by "Billboard" ranking the top-performing songs in the United States in the adult contemporary music (AC) genre. In 1989, 19 songs topped the chart, then published under the title Hot Adult Contemporary, based on playlists submitted by radio stations. In the year's first issue of "Billboard" the number one song was "Two Hearts" by Phil Collins, which was in its third week at number one, and would go on to spend three weeks at number one in 1989. Collins would also go on to have the final chart-topper of the year, as "Another Day in Paradise" occupied the top spot for the final five weeks of 1989. The eight weeks which Collins spent at number one during the year was the most by any act. The only other artist to achieve more than one chart-topper in 1989 was Cher, who spent a single week at number one with "If I Could Turn Back Time" and a further four with "After All", a duet with Peter Cetera. Two songs tied for the longest unbroken run at number one during the year, each spending six weeks atop the chart. British group Simply Red topped the chart for six weeks in June and July with "If You Don't Know Me by Now" and American vocalist Richard Marx had a similar run in August and September with "Right Here Waiting". In February, Canadian band Sheriff's song "When I'm with You" spent a single week at number one. The song had originally been a minor hit in the United States six years earlier, but was re-released in 1989, several years after the band had broken up, as part of a fad of radio programmers reviving songs from earlier in the decade which had not achieved success. The re-issued song went on to top not only the AC chart but also "Billboard"s all-genre listing, the Hot 100. AC number ones by Phil Collins, Mike and the Mechanics, Simply Red, the Bangles and Richard Marx also topped the Hot 100. Roy Orbison, who had died the previous December, achieved a posthumous Hot Adult Contemporary number one in February when "You Got It" topped the chart. Acts to top the Hot Adult Contemporary listing for the first time in 1989 included the southern rock group 38 Special. The uncharacteristic ballad "Second Chance", which spent two weeks in the top spot, was the only AC hit which the band achieved in its career.

Nenad Lalatović (, ; born 22 December 1977) is a Serbian professional football manager and former player. He is the current manager of Serbian SuperLiga club Vojvodina. Lalatović came through the youth system of Red Star Belgrade. He also spent a few seasons on loan at OFK Beograd, Radnički Kragujevac and Milicionar, before returning to Red Star Belgrade and becoming one of the team's most regular players in the early 2000s. Before moving abroad in the 2003 winter transfer window, Lalatović was named captain and made over 100 competitive appearances, winning four major domestic trophies with the "Crveno-beli". In January 2003, Lalatović was transferred to Ukrainian side Shakhtar Donetsk on a three-year deal. He failed to make an impact with the club, being loaned to VfL Wolfsburg in early 2004. After returning to Donetsk, Lalatović made a couple of appearances for the club in the title-winning 2004–05 season. He later received a one-year ban from the Ukrainian FA for assaulting the referee after a game between Shakhtar-2 and Zorya Luhansk in October 2005. In the 2006 winter transfer window, Lalatović returned to his homeland and joined Zemun. He spent six months with the "Gornjovarošani", before switching to OFK Beograd. Following the 2006–07 season, Lalatović retired from professional football, aged 29. Lalatović earned one cap for FR Yugoslavia at full level, coming on as a substitute for Vuk Rašović in a 1–1 friendly draw away to Greece on 13 December 2000. He was previously a member of the national under-21 team. After serving as an assistant to Miloš Veselinović, Lalatović took charge of Srem in April 2011. He subsequently served as manager of Proleter Novi Sad for the next two years. In June 2013, Lalatović replaced Aleksandar Janjić at the helm of Voždovac. He eventually switched to Napredak Kruševac in January 2014. On 23 June 2014, it was announced that Lalatović will be the new manager of Red Star Belgrade. He signed a one-year deal with an option for two more seasons. On 24 May 2015, after the final game of the 2014–15 season, Lalatović became unattached. On 29 June 2015, Lalatović was officially presented as manager of Borac Čačak. He led the club to a best-ever start to a league season by placing second after the initial 17 rounds. On 10 November 2015, Lalatović parted ways with Borac Čačak due to unpaid wages and bonuses to his players. On 11 November 2015, Lalatović was appointed manager of Vojvodina until the end of the 2015–16 season. He extended his contract with the club for one more year on 11 June 2016. However, Lalatović terminated his contract with the club by mutual consent on 17 December 2016. On 26 December 2016, Lalatović became manager of Čukarički, penning a four-year contract. He resigned from the position in May 2018, after failing to earn a spot in the UEFA Europa League. During his time at Čukarički, Lalatović also served as manager of the Serbia national under-21 team at the 2017 UEFA U-21 Championship. On 4 June 2018, Lalatović was named as new manager of Radnički Niš. On 21 June 2019, Lalatović was appointed as new manager of Vojvodina for the second time in his managerial career. On 24 June 2020, beating Partizan on penalties, Vojvodina won the 2019–20 Serbian Cup, which was Lalatović's first trophy as manager. In a July 2019 interview for fkvojvodina.rs, Lalatović's inability to work with foreign players became clear. Until then, during his coaching career, he was notorious for hiring strictly domestic players and releasing as many as foreign ones as he could. One of the reasons was his lack of knowledge of foreign languages, as he speaks only Serbian and Russian, thus being unable to communicate with players who speak other languages. When confronted with the issue during the interview, he made an effort to shift the blame to the foreign players, accusing them of laziness due to the fact that salaries were being received late. Curiously, all other coaches face the same problems and don't have the conflicts with foreign players that Lalatović has, so it seemed a cheap excuse. He went on to claim that had nothing against foreign players, but that they "need to be much more better than a domestic player" for him to respect them equally as he does domestic ones.

Arne Sakari Somersalo (born 18 March 1891 in Tampere as Arne Sommer – died 17 August 1941 near Kiestinki, Soviet Union) was a Finnish officer and anti-communist activist. Somersalo was educated at the University of Helsinki before studying natural sciences at the University of Jena. Based in Germany during the First World War he enrolled in the German Army as an officer in 1916, serving until the armistice. He would later claim that the war had been the death of old Europe and argued that one of its main positives was that it had "rescued our nation from the deadly, slimy embrace of a lothsome cuttlefish" in reference to Russia. He transferred straight to the Finnish Army and from 1920 to 1926 was the commander of the Finnish Air Force. He became involved in politics in 1926 when he started editing the right wing journal "Valkoinen Vartio" and then founded the fiercely anti-communist Finnish Defence League. He joined the Lapua Movement in 1930 then the Patriotic People's Movement (IKL) in 1932, serving as a delegate to the Parliament of Finland for the latter from 1933 to 1935 for Turku. He was also the editor in chief of the IKL party newspaper "Ajan Suunta" from 1931 to 1935. Ideologically he was a supporter of corporatism and was close to fascism. Recalled to active service for the Winter War, he acted as Chief of Staff for the frontline in Suomussalmi and was awarded the Order of the Cross of Liberty for his actions. During the Continuation War, Somersalo acted as a liaison officer for the German SS division Nord in Finnish Lapland. He was killed in action near Kiestinki (Kestenga), USSR on 17 August 1941.

Fausto Leali (born 29 October 1944, Nuvolento, Brescia, Italy) is an Italian pop singer. Leali began his musical career as a singer in several bands in his native Brescia. His first guitar teacher was Tullio Romano, of the band Los Marcellos Ferial. He released his first single in 1962 as 'Fausto Denis', for the magazine "Nuova Enigmistica Tascabile". Then, he joined a group from Alessandria, the Novelty, which had already released an EP in 1961. With the group he managed to obtain a recording contract with the Music record label, and began to release singles, including two covers of Beatles songs, "Please Please Me" and "Lei ti ama" ("She Loves You"). Leali's big opportunity came in 1966 when A&R executive Ezio Leoni moved from Music record label to Ri-Fi, bringing Leali and the band Novelty with him. Leali's first success was "A chi" ("To whom"), in 1967, an Italian version of a 1954 American song "Hurt", written by Roy Hamilton, also a track released years later by singer-songwriter Francesco De Gregori. "A chi" sold over one million copies, and was awarded a gold disc. In the same year, Leali took part for the first time in the television festival "Un disco per l'estate", with the song "Senza di te" ("Without you"), but did not progress beyond the first round. In 1969, 1971, and 1974, he appeared again in "Un disco per l'estate" with the songs "Tu non-meritavi una canzone" ("You did not deserve a song"), "Si chiama Maria" ("Her name is Maria"), and "Solo lei" ("Only you"). He returned to the hit parade in 1976 with the single "Io camminero" ("I will go"), which reached the top of charts, and in 1980 with a performance of Totò's song "Malafemmena" ("Bad woman" in Napolitan). In the late 1980s, he made several appearances at the Sanremo festival; in 1987, with "Io amo" ("I love"), that came in 4th; in 1988, with "Mi manchi" ("I miss you") at 5th; and in 1989, in the duet with Anna Oxa "Ti lascerò" ("I'll leave you") that won 1st place. The same year, Oxa and Leali represented Italy in the Eurovision Song Contest with "Avrei voluto" ("I wanted to"). The song was voted in the 9th place. Leali returned to Sanremo in 2002, with "Ora che ho bisogno di te" ("Now that I need you"), a duet with Luisa Corna, and the next year with "Eri tu" ("It was you"), which eventually went platinum. After taking part in 2006 in the Rai Due reality show, "Music Farm", where he reached the finals, Leali released a new album, "Profumo e Kerosene" ("Perfume and Kerosene"), with ten new songs, all in a new for him musical style. Due to his naturally hoarse singing style, Leali was nicknamed by the Italian media "Il negro bianco", "the white negro", also the title of his 1968 album. Ιn 1968, Leali married the singer Milena Cantù, who was with the record company founded by Adriano Celentano. They had a daughter, Deborah, so named after the success of the eponymous song of that year's Festival di Sanremo, sung at the competition in a duet with Wilson Pickett (it came in fourth place).

Ōhashi retired from acting in 2012. Ohashi made her acting debut at the age of three, and debuted as a singer with the song "Gake no Ue no Ponyo", which she sang together with the duo group Fujioka Fujimaki in 2007. "Gake no Ue no Ponyo" is the theme song of the 2008 Studio Ghibli anime film "Ponyo". When this single was first released on December 15, 2007, it debuted at 115 on the Oricon charts. After the release of "Ponyo", however, the single reached the number 3 position on the charts. It remained on the Oricon Top 10 charts for ten consecutive weeks, a record for an artist under the age of 10. This record was only broken by the single "Maru Maru Mori Mori!" in 2011. For singing "Gake no Ue no Ponyo", Ohashi was invited to participate in the 59th edition of "Kōhaku Uta Gassen", becoming the youngest participant in the history of this program.

KBNZ-LD, virtual and VHF digital channel 7, is a low-powered CBS-affiliated television station licensed to Bend, Oregon, United States and serving Central Oregon. Owned by the Zolo Media subsidiary of local cable company BendBroadband (itself a subsidiary of TDS), it is a sister station to ABC affiliate KOHD (channel 51). The two stations share studios on Lower Meadow Drive in Bend; KBNZ-LD's transmitter is located in the city on Awbrey Butte west of US 97. The station can also be seen on BendBroadband channel 6 and in high definition on digital channel 606. KBNZ originated in the mid-1980s as a low-powered translator of KOIN in Portland. In October 2008, KOIN owner New Vision Television announced plans to convert KBNZ into a local CBS affiliate with a separate feed. Four of KOIN's translators in Central Oregon were switched from airing KOIN's signal to that of KBNZ. It also received its own section on KOIN's website. Master control and some internal operations remained based at KOIN's studios at the KOIN Center in Downtown Portland. Although identifying as a separate station in its own right, KBNZ was considered a semi-satellite of KOIN. It cleared all network programming as provided through its parent and simulcast most of KOIN's newscasts, but aired a separate offering of syndicated programming; there were also separate station identifications and local commercial inserts. One reason that the station split from KOIN is a result of the Bend market growing in population. With the change, this leaves Meredith Corporation-owned MyNetworkTV affiliate KUBN-LP as the only area station serving as a full-time satellite of a Portland station. News personnel based at KBNZ began to contribute two to four local stories each day to air on KOIN broadcasts. It had been planned that as this station grew, a fully produced local newscast originating from Central Oregon would be introduced. KBNZ's signal does not reach far outside Bend. The only other area it reaches is Deschutes River Woods which is south of Bend and can only be obtained in the northern tip of the area. KBNZ's signal can also be seen in the western portion of Crook County. K31CR-D transmits a digital rebroadcast of KOIN programming and is not available east of Prineville but services an area larger than KBNZ. K31CR's signal reaches Crook, Jefferson, Deschutes, and Wasco counties. In contrast, KBNZ's signal does not exit Deschutes County. On March 31, 2010, BendBroadband bought KBNZ from New Vision Television through a subsidiary, Zolo Media. The new owner initially didn't plan any immediate or major changes. Since the ownership change, contact information for this station as well as listings for reporter Brittney Hopper and photographer Brandon Anderchuk have been removed, and the weather information for the Bend area on the KBNZ section has not been updated. In the summer of 2011, KBNZ launched a new website. Zolo Media also announced that it would take over master control operations from KOIN, starting on September 1. With the severing of the electronic umbilical cord with KOIN, KBNZ also dropped KOIN's 5:30 p.m. and 6 p.m. newscasts and rolled out a new logo. BendBroadband announced on May 1, 2014 that it would merge with Telephone and Data Systems, a Chicago-based cable firm, in a $261 million deal. In April, 2016, Zolo Media announced the debut of a local news program to air starting on May 2, 2016 on both KBNZ and KOHD called Central Oregon Daily. KBNZ currently airs newscasts weekdays at Noon, 6 PM, 7 PM and 11 PM, Saturdays at 6 PM, and Sundays at 6 PM and 11 PM. Since KBNZ is a low-powered station, it relies on translators to expand its reach. 

The Credit For Increasing Research Activities (R&D Tax Credit) is a general business tax credit under Internal Revenue Code Section 41 for companies that incur research and development (R&D) costs in the United States. The R&D Tax Credit was originally introduced in the Economic Recovery Tax Act of 1981 sponsored by U.S. Representative Jack Kemp and U.S. Senator William Roth. Since the credit's original expiration date of December 31, 1985, the credit has expired eight times and has been extended fifteen times. The last extension expired on December 31, 2014. In 2015, Congress made permanent the research and development tax credit in a measure of the government spending bill. With widespread concern that U.S. economic performance had fallen well below its potential, Congress passed 'The Economic Recovery Tax Act' (ERTA) of 1981. The ERTA was intended to act as an economic stimulus that would encourage investment within the United States. Congress perceived that research spending declines had adversely affected the Country's economic growth, productivity gains, and competitiveness within the global marketplace (defined by the fall of the U.S. automaker). Included within the ERTA was a provision called the 'Credit for Increasing Research Activities' (the Credit). The Credit was tailored to reverse the decline in U.S. research spending by providing an incentive that was premised on benefiting increases in (as opposed to total) year over year research spending. Originally embodied within House Report No. 97-201 (H.R. 4242) and then later codified by The Tax Reform Act of 1986, 'Qualified Research' generally constitutes private sector or commercially driven development effort intended to yield innovation within a scientific or technological field. However, administrative difficulties coupled with divergent interpretations by the IRS and Taxpayers have led to a series of revisions to the Code Section and related Treasury Regulations. In practice, 'Qualified Research' is often reduced to a "Four Part Test" to provide a frame of reference. However, this can be misleading due to the number of requirements or elements within each "Test" and the extensive Regulations that were provided to supplement some parts of Section 41 with examples. This convention belies the need for fact intensive evaluations and documentation of taxpayer research efforts over a period of time on the business component level (see below). This evaluation can be further complicated by a large body of case law and the need to reconcile research activities with allowable expenditures. Generally, qualified research is an activity or project undertaken by a taxpayer (directly or through direct funding of a third party on the taxpayers behalf) that comprises each of the four distinct elements: Permitted Purpose: The purpose of the activity or project must be to create new (or improve existing) functionality, performance, reliability, or quality of a business component. A business component is defined as any product, process, technique, invention, formula, or computer software (see exclusion for internal use software below) that the taxpayer intends to hold for sale, lease, license, or actual use in the taxpayer's trade or business. Elimination of Uncertainty: The taxpayer must intend to discover information that would eliminate uncertainty concerning the development or improvement of the business component. Uncertainty exists if the information available to the taxpayer does not establish the capability of development or improvement, method of development or improvement, or the appropriateness of the business component's design. Process of Experimentation: The taxpayer must undergo a systematic process designed to evaluate one or more alternatives to achieve a result where the capability or the method of achieving that result, or the appropriate design of that result, is uncertain as of the beginning of the taxpayer's research activities. Treasury Regulations define this as broadly as conventional implementation of the scientific method to something as informal as systematic trial and error process. Technological in Nature: The process of experimentation used to discover information must fundamentally rely on principles of the physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science. A taxpayer may employ existing technologies and may rely on existing principles of the physical or biological sciences, engineering, or computer science to satisfy this requirement. Notwithstanding the general application and evaluation of the requirements stated above, the following do not constitute qualified research. The Research and Experimentation Tax Credit hinges on the quantification of eligible expenses during one of three possible base periods. The three base period calculation methods are referred to as the Traditional Credit Calculation, Start-Up Credit Calculation, and Alternative Simplified Credit. The eligible expenses or qualified research expenditures include four types of expenses. The quantification of each of these varies based on each company's accounting methodologies. 41(b)(2)(D)Wages for in-house research and development activities usually constitute the majority of expenses eligible for the credit. The research expenditure is only eligible if the wage is paid to the employee for the performance of a qualified service. Qualified Services consist of: "Engaging in qualified research" means the direct conduct of research and development. "Directly supervising qualified research" is the first-line supervision of qualified research. This does not include the higher-level managers to whom the first-line supervisors report. "Supporting qualified research" includes an employee's time spent aiding the direct conduct of research and development. This includes data recording, prototype building, and performing test/trials. Companies must provide contemporaneous documentation that links an employee's time directly to a project or activity. This documentation takes the form of two methods; Project Approach and Departmental Approach. The project approach relies on a taxpayer's time tracking documentation to directly link an employee's hours to a specific qualified R&D project. The departmental approach relies on oral testimony, contemporaneous engineering documentation, job descriptions, educational background, and other information to develop a time estimate. I.R.C. §41(b)(2)(C) defines the term supply to mean any tangible property other than land or land improvements, and property subject to depreciation. Supply expense must be directly linked to qualified research activities using the taxpayer's accounting system. This can include using general ledgers or job summary reports. Qualified supplies include prototypes and testing materials. The taxpayer cannot include travel, shipping, or royalty expenses as supply expenses. I.R.C. §41(b)(2)(B) and Treasury Regulation §1.41-2(e) requires a third party to perform a qualified research service on behalf of the taxpayer; and requires the taxpayer to make payment to the third party regardless of success. The "on behalf of" is refined by I.R.C. §1.41-2(e)(3), which requires the taxpayer to have rights into the research results. The contract research payments are included at 65% of the actual expense. I.R.C. §41(e)(2) qualifies basic research payments made to qualified non-profit organizations and institutions. Basic research refers to fundamental research that focuses on evaluating theories and hypotheses regardless of an application. Basic research payments are included at 75% of the actual expense. The R&D Tax Credit allows for three calculation methods based on the taxpayer's date of incorporation, initiation of qualified research, and ability to collect required contemporaneous documentation. The Traditional Credit Calculation and Start-Up Credit Calculation provide a credit of 20% of the taxpayers qualified research expenditures that exceed a calculated base amount. The Alternative Simplified Credit Calculation provides a credit of 14% of the taxpayer's qualified research expenditures that exceed a calculated base amount. Regardless of calculation method the base amount cannot be less than 50% of the taxpayer's current year qualified expenditures. The following sections describe the three calculation methods; Traditional Credit Calculation, Start-Up Credit Calculation, and Alternative Simplified Credit. I.R.C. §41(c)(3)(A) establishes a fixed-base percentage calculation for companies that incorporated prior to January 1, 1984 and had 3 or more tax years with qualified research expenditures and revenue between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1988. The fixed-base percentage is calculated by dividing the taxpayers aggregate qualified research expenses by the aggregate gross receipts for taxable years beginning after December 31, 1983, and before January 1, 1989. For purposes of the calculation, the resulting fixed-base percentage is multiplied by the average of the taxpayer's gross revenue for the 4 years prior to the calculation year. The fixed-base percentage should only change for purposes of meeting the consistency rule or adjusting for an acquisition or disposition. I.R.C. §41(c)(3)(B) establishes a fixed-base percentage calculation for companies that incorporated after December 31, 1983, or had fewer than 3 years with qualified research expenditures and revenue between January 1, 1984 and December 31, 1988. The fixed-base percentage is calculated according to the code as follows. For purposes of the calculation, the resulting fixed-base percentage is multiplied by the average of the taxpayer's gross revenue for the 4 years prior to the calculation year. The fixed-base percentage should only change for purposes of meeting the consistency rule or adjusting for an acquisition or disposition. For those companies that cannot adequately substantiate qualified research expenditures for the Traditional or Start-Up calculation methods, or generate fixed-base-percentages that significantly limit the credit, the I.R.C. §41(c)(5) provides an alternative calculation method. This calculation provides a credit equal to 14 percent of the current year qualified research expenses that exceed 50 percent of the average qualified research expenses for the 3 preceding taxable years. As of January 1, 2009, this calculation supplanted the Alternative Incremental Research Credit election. Since this calculation method is an election, a taxpayer may not apply for this calculation method retroactively. Additionally, I.R.C. §41(c)(5)(C) states this election applies to all of the taxpayer's future claims unless revoked with the consent of the Secretary. To further supplement the calculation methods and definitions of qualified research and experimentation, the R&D Tax Credit provides special rules for various situations. The following sections briefly describe some of these special rules. In order to accurately calculate a credit, the taxpayer is required to define qualified research expenditures the same from year to year, per I.R.C. §41(c)(5)(A). If a taxpayer changes their definition of qualified expenditures due to the results of an audit, tax court case ruling, or publication of an IRS document, the tax payer must accordingly change their definition for prior years that will affect the results of one of the three calculation methods. I.R.C. §280C(c)(3) allows the taxpayer to elect a reduced credit amount thereby eliminating the requirement to deduct qualified research expenditures claimed for the R&D Tax Credit. This election can only be made on a timely return. A group of corporations that maintain more than 50% common ownership are treated as one taxpayer for purposes of the R&D Tax Credit. Special brother/sister and spouse rules factor into determining ownership. The credits generated for the I.R.C. §41 can be carried forward 20 years and may be carried back 1 year. Companies can monetize the federal R&D tax credit in a few different ways. Traditionally, it is taken against income taxes. However, qualified small businesses can apply up to $250,000 to payroll taxes each year. To qualify for the payroll tax offset, a business must have less than $5 million in revenue and be within five years of its first gross receipt. The legislative intent for the R&D Tax Credit is to increase R&D spending in the United States. Currently separate bills are being proposed in the House of Representatives and the Senate. The House of Representatives bill, cosponsored by U.S. Representatives Kendrick Meek and Kevin Brady, H.R. 422 proposes to make the credit permanent and increase the Alternative Simplified Credit from 14% to 20%. Senators Max Baucus and Orrin Hatch are cosponsoring bill S. 1203. This bill proposes to make the credit permanent, increase the Alternative Simplified Credit from 14% to 20%, and terminate the other calculation methods. In the 112th Congress, Representative Rush Holt is sponsoring H.R. 134 to make the R&D Tax Credit permanent. The American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2014 (H.R. 4438; 113th Congress) was introduced into the House of Representatives during the 113th United States Congress. The bill would amend the Internal Revenue Code to modify the calculation method and the rate for the tax credit for qualified research expenses that expired at the end of 2013 and would make that modified credit permanent. The bill was supported by organizations such as the National Taxpayers Union and Americans for Tax Reform, but was opposed by the Obama Administration because it did not pay for the credits with any offsets. The magnitude of the R&D Tax Credit's economic effects are debated by many economists but a majority of them agree the credit does increase R&D spending in the United States. While measuring the actual effect of the credit is difficult, a 2005 study by Ernst & Young measured the amount of dollars returned to companies in the form of the R&D Tax Credit.

Captain Earl McNabb Hand (10 March 1897 – 19 March 1954) was a Canadian World War I flying ace credited with five confirmed aerial victories and two unconfirmed ones. Hand was born in Saint Ste. Marie, the son of Thomas A. Hand and Hannah Jane Hand. Hand joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force on April 7, 1916. Soon, he was sent to France's Western Front. Hand began his victory roll while flying a Sopwith Camel for 45 Squadron. He tallied his first win when he drove an Albatros D.V down out of control at Langemark-Poelkapelle, Belgium on 15 November 1917. After 45 Squadron shifted from the Western Front to Italy, Hand had a couple of unconfirmed claims on 11 January 1918; he then scored four times between 30 January and 9 May 1918. A summary of his victories shows four destroyed enemy airplanes, one confirmed and two unconfirmed driven down out of control. On 1 June 1918, Hand was shot down by Austro-Hungarian ace Frank Linke-Crawford. Linke-Crawford hit the gas tank of Hand's Camel and set it afire; somehow, Hand survived both the flames and the impact of the crash. However, he was badly burned and taken prisoner. Hand was repatriated in 1919 and returned to Canada. He became a magistrate. He also helped found the Toronto Flying Club.

Abū ‘Amr ‘Uthmān ibn ‘Abd il-Raḥmān Ṣalāḥ al-Dīn al-Kurdī al-Shahrazūrī (c. 1181 CE/577 AH – 1245/643), commonly known as Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ, was a Kurdish Shafi'i hadith specialist and the author of the seminal "Introduction to the Science of Hadith". He was originally from Sharazora region in Sulaymaniyah province in Iraqi Kurdistan, was raised in Mosul and then resided in Damascus, where he died. Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ was born in the year 1181 CE/577 AH in Sharazor. He first studied "fiqh" with his father in Sharazor, located in the south-eastern part of what is currently referred to as Iraqi Kurdistan. He then occupied himself in Mosul for an unknown period of time, studying under a number of local religious scholars. He studied in a number of cities, including: Baghdad, Hamedan, Naysabur, Merv, Aleppo, Damascus and Harran. Ibn Khallikan said that he had heard that Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ had repeatedly read "al-Muhathab", one of the primary texts of the Shafi'i Madh'hab, "before his mustache had grown."<ref name="Siyar, 23/140-4"></ref> He read "Sahih al-Bukhari" upon two of his teachers, al-Mayyad ibn Muhammad al-Tusi and Mansur ibn 'Abd al-Mun'im al-Furawi, as well as "Al-Sunan al-Kubra", by al-Bayhaqi, upon the latter.<ref name="Dhail al-Taqyid, 3/111"></ref> While Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ was most recognized for his contribution to the field of hadith, he was well-grounded in a variety of disciplines. Ibn Khallikan described him as being from amongst the exemplary scholars of Quranic exegesis, hadith and jurisprudence, participating in a number of religious disciplines and producing sound religious verdicts. Al-Fasi described him as being "a master in both jurisprudence and hadith, and other than that." He was also described by al-Dhahabi as "strong in the Arabic Language" and as "the shaikh of the Shafi'i scholars." Ibn al-Hajib described Ibn al-Salah as being broad in his knowledge of both primary issues ("al-usul") and peripheral ("al-furu`"). Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ held several positions throughout his life, primarily in the field of education. He taught at the Salahiyyah School in Jerusalem, and then, following the destruction of its city walls, moved to Damascus and taught at the Rawahiyyah School for some time following its inception. Following the foundation of Dar al-Hadith Ashrafiyyah, he became its shaikh and was the first to teach and give verdicts there in the year 530 AH. It was here that he dictated his work Introduction to the Science of Hadith to his students. He was then appointed a teacher at the al-Shamiyyah al-Sughara School. Ibn al-Salah had a number of students, some of whom achieved prominence in their own right; from them: Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ clarified his position on philosophy, describing it as: "The basis of foolishness and degeneration, a topic of confusion and misguidance which is motivated by perversion and blasphemy. Whosoever engages in philosophy, has been blinded in his insight into the great aspects of the Sharia corroborated by evidences." Due to his insistence no one was allowed to read the subjects of rhetoric or philosophy in Damascus, a matter which the leaders supported. Ibn al-Ṣalāḥ died on Monday, September 18, 1245 CE/643 AH, at the age of 66. His funeral prayer was performed at the congregational mosque of Damascus, to a crowd so large it required a second prayer to accommodate. He was buried in the "Sufiyyah" graveyard, now the location of a hospital, a mosque and other buildings. Ibn al-Salah had a number of works the most notable named below in addition to others on individual issues.

Ferritic nitrocarburizing or FNC, also known by the proprietary names Tenifer, Tufftride and Melonite as well as ARCOR, is a range of proprietary case hardening processes that diffuse nitrogen and carbon into ferrous metals at sub-critical temperatures during a salt bath. Other methods of ferric nitrocarburizing include gaseous process such as Nitrotec and ion (plasma) ones. The processing temperature ranges from to , but usually occurs at . At this temperature steels and other ferrous alloys are still in a ferritic phase, which is advantageous compared to other case hardening processes that occur in the austenitic phase. There are four main classes of ferritic nitrocarburizing: "gaseous", "salt bath", "ion" or "plasma", and "fluidized-bed". The process is used to improve three main surface integrity aspects including scuffing resistance, fatigue properties, and corrosion resistance. It has the added advantage of inducing little shape distortion during the hardening process. This is because of the low processing temperature, which reduces thermal shocks and avoids phase transitions in steel. The first ferritic nitrocarburizing methods were done at low temperatures, around , in a liquid salt bath. The first company to successfully commercialize the process was the Imperial Chemical Industries in Great Britain. ICI called their process "the cassel" due to the plant where it was developed or "Sulfinuz" treatment because it had sulfur in the salt bath. While the process was very successful with high-speed spindles and cutting tools, there were issues with cleaning the solution off because it was not very water soluble. Because of the cleaning issues the Joseph Lucas Limited company began experimenting with gaseous forms of ferritic nitrocarburizing in the late 1950s. The company applied for a patent by 1961. It produced a similar surface finish as the Sulfinuz process with the exception of the formation of sulfides. The atmosphere consisted of ammonia, hydrocarbon gases, and a small amount of other carbon-containing gases. This spurred the development of a more environmentally friendly salt bath process by the German company Degussa after acquiring ICI patents. Their process is the widely known as the Tufftride or Tenifer process. Following this the ion nitriding process was invented in the early 1980s. This process had faster cycle times, required less cleaning and preparation, formed deeper cases, and allowed for better control of the process. Despite the naming the process is a modified form of nitriding and not carburizing. The shared attributes of this class of this process is the introduction of nitrogen and carbon in the ferritic state of the material. The processes are broken up into four main classes: "gaseous", "salt bath", "ion" or "plasma", or "fluidized-bed". The trade name and patented processes may vary slightly from the general description, but they are all a form of ferritic nitrocarburizing. Salt bath ferritic nitrocarburizing is also known as liquid ferritic nitrocarburizing or liquid nitrocarburizing and is also known by the trademarked names Tufftride and Tenifer. The simplest form of this process is encompassed by the trademarked Melonite process, also known as Meli 1. It is most commonly used on steels, sintered irons, and cast irons to lower friction and improve wear and corrosion resistance. The process uses a salt bath of alkali cyanate. This is contained in a steel pot that has an aeration system. The cyanate thermally reacts with the surface of the workpiece to form alkali carbonate. The bath is then treated to convert the carbonate back to a cyanate. The surface formed from the reaction has a compound layer and a diffusion layer. The compound layer consists of iron, nitrogen, and oxygen, is abrasion resistant, and stable at elevated temperatures. The diffusion layer contains nitrides and carbides. The surface hardness ranges from 800 to 1500 HV depending on the steel grade. This also inversely affects the depth of the case; i.e. a high carbon steel will form a hard, but shallow case. A similar process is the trademarked Nu-Tride process, also known incorrectly as the Kolene process (which is actually the company's name), which includes a preheat and an intermediate quench cycle. The intermediate quench is an oxidizing salt bath at . This quench is held for 5 to 20 minutes before final quenching to room temperature. This is done to minimize distortion and to destroy any lingering cyanates or cyanides left on the workpiece. Other trademarked processes are Sursulf and Tenoplus. Sursulf has a sulfur compound in the salt bath to create surface sulfides which creates porosity in the workpiece surface. This porosity is used to contain lubrication. Tenoplus is a two-stage high-temperature process. The first stage occurs at , while the second stage occurs at . Gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing is also known as controlled nitrocarburizing, soft nitriding, and vacuum nitrocarburizing or by the tradenames UltraOx, Nitrotec, Nitemper, Deganit, Triniding, Corr-I-Dur, Nitroc, NITREG-C and Nitrowear, Nitroneg. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath process, except gaseous mixtures are used to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece. The parts are first cleaned, usually with a vapor degreasing process, and then nitrocarburized around , with a process time that ranges from one to four hours. The actual gas mixtures are proprietary, but they usually contain ammonia and an endothermic gas. Plasma-assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing is also known as ion nitriding, plasma ion nitriding or glow-discharge nitriding. The process works to achieve the same result as the salt bath and gaseous process, except the reactivity of the media is not due to the temperature but to the gas ionized state. In this technique intense electric fields are used to generate ionized molecules of the gas around the surface to diffuse the nitrogen and carbon into the workpiece. Such highly active gas with ionized molecules is called plasma, naming the technique. The gas used for plasma nitriding is usually pure nitrogen, since no spontaneous decomposition is needed (as is the case of gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing with ammonia). Due to the relatively low temperature range ( to ) generally applied during plasma-assisted ferritic nitrocarburizing and gentle cooling in the furnace, the distortion of workpieces can be minimized. Stainless steel workpieces can be processed at moderate temperatures (like ) without the formation of chromium nitride precipitates and hence maintaining their corrosion resistance properties. An additional step can be added to the nitrocarburizing process called postoxidation. When properly performed, postoxidation creates a layer of black oxide (FeO), that greatly increases the corrosion resistance of the treated substrate while leaving an aesthetically attractive black color. Since the introduction of the Glock pistol in 1982, this type of nitrocarburizing with postoxidation finish has become popular as a factory finish for military style handguns. These processes are most commonly used on low-carbon, low-alloy steels, however they are also used on medium and high-carbon steels. Common applications include spindles, cams, gears, dies, hydraulic piston rods, and powdered metal components. Glock Ges.m.b.H., an Austrian firearms manufacturer, utilized the Tenifer process until 2010, to protect the barrels and slides of the pistols they manufacture. The finish on a Glock pistol is the third and final hardening process. It is thick and produces a 64 Rockwell C hardness rating via a nitride bath. The final matte, non-glare finish meets or exceeds stainless steel specifications, is 85% more corrosion resistant than a hard chrome finish, and is 99.9% salt-water corrosion resistant. After the Tenifer process, a black Parkerized finish is applied and the slide is protected even if the finish were to wear off. In 2010 Glock switched to a gaseous ferritic nitrocarburizing process. Besides Glock several other pistol manufacturers, including Smith & Wesson and Springfield Armory, Inc., also use ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts like barrels and slides but they call it Melonite finish. Heckler & Koch use a nitrocarburizing process they refer to as Hostile Environment. Pistol manufacturer Caracal International L.L.C. uses ferritic nitrocarburizing for finishing parts such as barrels and slides with the plasma-based post oxidation process (PlasOx). Grandpower, a Slovakian firearms producer, also uses a quench polish quench (QPQ) treatment to harden metal parts on its K100 pistols.

Indian country jurisdiction, or the extent which tribal powers apply to legal situations in the United States, has undergone many drastic shifts since the beginning of European settlement in America. Over time, federal statutes and Supreme Court rulings have designated more or less power to tribal governments, depending on federal policy toward Indians. Numerous Supreme Court decisions have created important precedents in Indian country jurisdiction, such as "Worcester v. Georgia", "Oliphant v. Suquamish Tribe", and "Montana v. United States". There have been many shifts in policy towards Indian Jurisdiction in the history of the United States. There are six major periods of policy regarding American Indians. The first is the British Colonial and Early U.S. Era, which was followed the Removal Era. The next period was the Allotment Era. The Reorganization Era was next and then the Termination Era. The last era is the one we are currently in, the Self-Determination Era. Different U.S. Supreme Court cases and Congressional rulings have shifted United States policy regarding Indian Jurisdiction, creating the different eras. The British passed the Proclamation of 1763 which created a boundary line between the British colonies and the American Indians lands west of the Appalachian Mountains. The proclamation forbade the British colonists from moving beyond the proclamation line into Indian Territory. Important legislations passed by the United States Congress in early United States history were the Indian Intercourse Acts. They were passed in 1780, and then they expired and were renewed every two years until 1802, when permanent legislation was passed. The final Indian Intercourse Act was passed in 1834. These acts did many things, including regulating relations between Indians and non-Indians living on Indian land and defining "Indian Country." After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the United States began to extensively negotiate with the Indians in this newly acquired territory. U.S. citizens saw the land as being very fertile and as if it was theirs for the taking and because of this many land disputes arose between Indians and non-Indians in this region. The first case that allowed the American seizure of Indian lands was "Johnson v. McIntosh", which stated that when a European nation discovered land in the new world, that it also gained the right to take the land from the natives by purchase or by conquest. At this time, states wanted to remove Indians from their territory, which led to more treaties and the establishment of the controversial policy of U.S. ethnic cleansing. These feelings resulted in the Indian Removal Act, when Congress authorized President Andrew Jackson to take land away from Indians and give them land in the West. It was the Indian Removal Act that helped Jackson set into place the Trail of Tears in 1831. In the 1870s and 1880s there was an increasing amount of disapproval in regard to the government's reservation policy. People were seeing the Indians in two different ways. One group saw the Indians as a group of people living in poverty and shambles, while another group saw the Indians as a group of people causing large tracts of land to be excluded from white settlers. The combination of the two groups of people and their points of view led to the production of the General Allotment Act of 1887, also known as the Dawes Act. Allotments of 160 acres were handed out to each head of a family. Double amounts were handed out if the land was to be used for grazing. could also be given to each additional member of the household. The government would retain the title handed out through the General Allotment Act for 25 years. This time period intended on doing two things. First, it would protect the allottee from immediately having to pay state taxes. Second, the land owner would learn how to manage his land and affairs. However, after the 25 years was up, many Indians found themselves subject to excessive state property taxes, which resulted in the sale of much of the land which Indians received through the Dawes Act. Very soon after many of the Indians losing the land which they earned through the Dawes Act, white settlers moved in on these open lots. This created a checkerboard effect, and made it nearly impossible to have sizable gains in farming and grazing. The Indian Allotment Act had disastrous effects on the Native Americans. During the Allotment Act, the Native American population reached its lowest point in history. in 1900, the Native American population in the United States was only 250,000. There was also a substantial decrease in the amount of land owned by Native Americans. In 1887 the Indians had held . By 1934, the amount of land held by Indians had dropped to , and of that over was desert. The Allotment period was coming to a close in 1924 when Congress passed a statute granting citizenship to all Indians born within the United States. In 1928 the famous Meriam Report was released. The Meriam Report documented the utter failure of the Dawes Act and the allotment policy. The passage of the Indian Reorganization Act in 1934 officially marks the beginning of the Reorganization period. The Indian Reorganization Act ended the practice of allotment. It sought to protect the tribes and allow them to establish the legal structures for their own self-governments. The tribes were now authorized to create their own constitutions and laws, which could be ratified by a vote among the tribal members. After decades of misfortune and loss of culture and property, the Indian Reorganization Act put a stop to the destruction of the tribes. Unclear jurisdictional boundaries between states and tribes prompted the beginning of the Indian termination policy era. The termination era began when Congress passed House Concurrent Resolution 108 in 1953, which stated: Whereas it is the policy of Congress, as rapidly as possible, to make the Indians within the territorial limits of the United States subject to the same laws and entitled to the same privileges and responsibilities as are applicable to other citizens of the United States, to end their status as wards of the United States, and to grant them all the rights and prerogatives pertaining to American citizenship... The policy of termination has been seen as a direct attack on the sovereignty of Indian nations - without being considered a reservation or a nation, Indian tribes lost jurisdiction, taxation protection, and were emerged them into a different world. The Bureau of Indian Affairs attempted to prevent termination for some tribes by insisting the need for governmental assistance for tribes such as the Potawatomi Tribe of Kansas: They ... have failed to acquire the necessary ambition, providence, and sense of responsibility to rise above their economic level. Efforts from the BIA did not stop the process of termination. In the twelve years of this policy, 109 tribes were terminated, with severe effects on education, health care, and economic stability. Cold War policies likely affected the policy of termination. Several reservations and nations enacted social programs, such as health care, on their citizens and socialism was easily connected with the Soviet Union. This fear likely drove Congress to move towards termination. Termination might have been seen as a method of "freeing" tribes from the BIA and other governmental programs, but the policy likely hindered the efforts of Native Americans for tribal self-rule. Presidents Lyndon B. Johnson and Richard Nixon would lead the nation away from termination into self-determination. The policy of termination was ultimately recognized as a failure by the late 1960s, and federal policy regarding Indians shifted toward that of self-determination, or the right of a group or nation to independently govern themselves. The legislation that has arisen from this policy of self-determination, which has been in effect since the late 1960s to the present day, has greatly influenced modern-day Indian country jurisdiction. One example of this legislation is the Indian Civil Rights Act of 1968, which imposed most of the requirements of the Bill of Rights on the tribes and amended Public Law 280. This legislation both broadened and restricted tribal jurisdiction. The passage of the Act rejected the termination policy by requiring constitutional procedure by the tribal government, but it also limited tribal jurisdiction by limiting the independence of tribal government. The Civil Rights Act of 1968 also amended Public Law 280 so that states no longer held civil and criminal jurisdiction over Indian country unless the tribes consented at certain elections. Also, in relation to the extension of state law into Indian country, in the 1983 Supreme Court case, "New Mexico v. Mescalero Apache Tribe" (462 U.S. 324, 334, 1983), it is held that state jurisdiction is permitted to interfere in tribal self-government in circumstances where "the state interests at stake are sufficient to justify the assertion of state authority". In "National Farmers Union Ins. Cos. v. Crow Tribe" (471 U.S. 845 1885), a case involving civil jurisdiction in Indian country, the Supreme Court held that parties must first exhaust tribal court remedies before seeking federal court review of such questions. The 2001 case "Nevada v. Hicks" (533 U.S. 355) further limited Indian country jurisdiction by holding that inherent tribal jurisdiction does not extend to state officials who commit crimes on reservation trust lands. Contemporary Indian country jurisdiction has been shaped over the years by the rulings of many Supreme Court cases and federal statutes involving criminal and civil jurisdiction within Indian country. Today, the jurisdiction of Federal, state, or tribal courts usually depends upon whether the parties involved are considered to be Indians or tribal members, the nature of the offense, and whether the events of the case took place in Indian country. Though the definition varies, a person is usually considered an Indian if he or she has some Indian blood and is considered an Indian by the community. Blood requirements may vary from state to state, but often it is enough to have a parent, grandparent, or great-grandparent qualify as an Indian. To be identified as an Indian for federal and statutory purposes, however, a person must be a member of a federally recognized tribe. Indian Country, as defined by Congress in 1948 (18 U.S.C.A. 1151) is: a) "all land within the limits of any Indian reservation under the jurisdiction of the United States government, notwithstanding the issuance of any patent, and including rights-of way running through the reservation, b) all dependent Indian communities within the borders of the U.S. whether within the original or subsequently acquired territory thereof, and whether within or without the limits of a state, and c) all Indian allotments, the Indian titles to which have not been extinguished, including rights of way running through the same." This definition of Indian country includes all territory within an Indian reservation, even land owned by non-Indians in fee simple. Reservation land opened to settlement by non-Indians is still considered Indian country, unless Congress explicitly states its decision to remove the lands from reservation status and hence diminish the Indian country boundaries. Diminishment may occur in other ways, yet retain the meaning of Indian Country. For example, when the Devils Lake Sioux litigated the question of tribal authority against the North Dakota Public Service Commission, which was operating within reservation borders, the court, relying in part on interpretations of 'Indian Character', ruled that the tribe had no authority over privately held lands even though more Indians than non-Indians lived on the reservation, yet more acreage was held in non-Indian ownership. Many tribes, such as the Yakama in Washington state, have designated 'open' and 'closed' areas, reflecting this difference in the interpretation of jurisdiction. All of the political and legal interpretations of this situation may not eliminate the meaning of Indian Country, but as such they obscure the increasing diminishment of tribal sovereignty within reservation borders. Some federal criminal statutes are applicable throughout the entire nation, including Indian country, and apply to both Indians and non-Indians, such as treason, theft involving the U.S. mail, the Organized Crime Control Act, Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), and the Contraband Cigarette Trafficking Act. The General Crimes Act (18 U.S.C. § 1152) and the Major Crimes Act, (18 U.S.C. § 1153) encompass other crimes and determine the jurisdiction when concerning particular cases. The General Crimes Act of 1817 provides for the prosecution of crimes by non-Indians against Indians and of non-major crimes by Indians against non-Indians through the application of federal law. There are three exceptions to the Act, in which it does not apply to the following: crimes by Indians against Indians, crimes by Indians that received punishment through the tribe, and crimes in which a treaty gives exclusive jurisdiction to the tribe The Major Crimes Act of 1885 establishes federal jurisdiction in the prosecution of serious crimes committed by Indians in Indian country. Federal civil jurisdiction is very limited in Indian country. Federal courts have jurisdiction in claims that arise under federal law and in cases of diversity of citizenship. Federal courts have no jurisdiction in civil cases involving divorce, adoption, child custody, or probate. Tribal criminal jurisdiction over Indians in Indian country is complete and exclusive unless there is a federal statute deeming it otherwise or limiting it in some way. Exclusive jurisdiction is given to the tribal courts over non-major crimes committed by Indians against Indians in Indian country, as well as victimless Indian crimes. Jurisdiction is also granted, though not exclusively, to tribal courts over non-major crimes by Indians against non-Indians. In these cases, federal courts also have jurisdiction through the General Crimes Act, so jurisdiction is shared. Tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction in civil cases against any Indian in Indian country. This includes cases brought against an Indian by a non-Indian in Indian country, and all cases between tribal members that arise in Indian country. Exclusive jurisdiction over tribal subject matter also belongs to the tribal courts. In divorce cases, tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over divorces between Indians living in Indian country. In some divorce cases involving Indians living outside Indian country, the tribal and state courts may have concurrent jurisdiction. The Indian Child Welfare Act of 1978 provides for tribal jurisdiction in adoption and custody cases of Indian children who are domiciled in Indian country. Children ultimately take the domicile of their parents, and children born to unwed parents take the domicile of their mother. Tribal courts also exercise jurisdiction in adoption and custody matters of Indian children who are tribal members. In cases involving probate, tribal courts have exclusive jurisdiction over non-trust movable assets of Indians residing in Indian country. States have limited criminal jurisdiction in relation to crimes committed in Indian country. In general, states exercise limited civil jurisdiction in cases involving non-Indians, and sometimes non-tribal members, when these cases arise in Indian country. In divorce cases, states have jurisdiction if both parties are non-Indian and living in Indian country. In matters involving adoption and child custody proceeding between parents, the division of jurisdiction is very similar. The states only have jurisdiction over cases involving the adoption and custody of Indian children not domiciled in Indian country. In probate cases, states have jurisdiction regarding cases of non-trust estates of Indians who died while they were domiciled outside of Indian country and also in cases dealing with any land outside of Indian country. 

On October 15, 1933 Fukui-Ekimae Station opened to the public. Fukui-Ekimae Station closed and was relocated as Fukui-eki Station to the square in front of the west station building of Fukui Station. All Fukubu Line trains served Fukui-Ekimae station. Fukui-Ekimae Station was a single platform located approximately 150 meters west of Fukui Station in the median of Densha-dōri. A roof and incline were added after the introduction of low-floor trains and disabled access improvements. Densha-dōri passes through Fukui's main downtown shopping area. The road and arcades on either side were under construction until March 2006, when an underground parking deck was completed. JR and Echizen Railway Fukui Station was located approximately 150 meters to the east; the Echizen Railway terminal was on the eastern side of the JR West station. 

Hector Fonseca (born January 10, 1980 in Bronx, New York City, New York) is an internationally acclaimed house music DJ. In addition to his production and DJ work, Fonseca is one of the music industry's most requested remixers due to his ability to transform many commercially released songs into club hits. Raised in suburban Clifton, New Jersey in a very, tight-knit Puerto Rican family, Hector first started to dabble with notoriety with a brief career in as a fashion model. While his success in that industry was limited, Hector decided to pursue other ambitious ventures and later enrolled at the University of Pennsylvania where he majored in business administration for three years. It was in college that his passion for music began to grow, and after serious consideration, he left his studies to focus on the growing tribal and house music scene emerging in New York during the late 1990s. With his experience and a loyal following of fans, word of mouth began to circulate throughout New York's music scene of Hector's rising stock. Soon, he could boast of residencies at most of New York City's legendary nightclubs such as the Limelight, Heaven, Splash & Roxy, along with numerous national gigs. With a list of venues that read like a who's who of city nightclubs, he soon attracted the attention of his mentor, the late Grammy Award-winning DJ/producer/remixer Peter Rauhofer. Rauhofer, the founder and proprietor of dance music label, "Star69 Records", wanted to verify whether or not Fonseca's musical means extended beyond the turntables. In the summer of 2004, with just two years of producing music under his belt, Fonseca solidified his spot in dance music's hall of fame with his rendition of Jahkey B's single, "Heart Attack". His remix of the song pushed the song to the #8 spot on Billboard's Hot Dance Club Songs chart. His follow-up of Shelia Brody's "U Ain’t that Good" reached #3 on the same chart, further solidifying his reputation as one of the dance music industry's go to remixers. Credited with starting the now popular "electribal" sound (a mixture of tribal, vocal and electro house), he was voted Out Magazine's Hottest DJ in 2007. Some of the major circuit party events he has headlined in the past include the White Party (both Palm Springs and Miami), the Black Party (New York), the Black and Blue Festival (Montreal), Circuit Festival (Barcelona), the Winter Party (Miami), Amore (Rome), Maxima (Rio de Janeiro), Alegria (New York), Prism Pride (Toronto) and Scream (Paris) to name just a few. In addition to these events, he holds residencies at some of the most popular venues worldwide including "Matinee" (New York City and Ibiza), '"Fly" (Toronto) "Parking" (Montreal), "Score" (Miami) and "Reflex" (Los Angeles). He has charted dozens of Billboard #1 Dance Chart remixes for various artists including Betty Who, Beyoncé, Erika Jayne, Katy Perry, Kerli, Lenny Kravitz, Lady Gaga, Mel B, Rihanna, Petshop Boys, Sia & many others. In 2013 he penned his first original composition/collaboration with legendary 80s band Blondie titled "Mile High". He also collaborated in 2014 with club divas Natascha Bessez, Inaya Day & Maya Simantov for his upcoming self-titled album released by the Audio4play Records label. An independent house music label he started with label partner Theresa Velasquez. 

Spyros Rath () (1902 - 15 September 1983) was a mayor of the municipality of Corfu, Greece. He was the last elected mayor before the Greek military junta of 1967–1974 replaced him and until 1974 the Local Government was appointed by municipal councils. In his memory the Municipality of Corfu awards every year the "Rath prize" to young people from Corfu for their artistic or sports performances. In the Kephalomantouko area of Corfu there is a street on his name. 

Antonio Jiménez Sistachs (; born 12 October 1970), sometimes known just as Toni, is a Spanish retired footballer who played as a goalkeeper, and a goalkeeping coach. He appeared in 236 La Liga matches over nine seasons, seven of those spent with Espanyol. He also represented in the competition Rayo Vallecano and Atlético Madrid. Toni helped Spain win the gold medal at the 1992 Summer Olympics. Born in La Garriga, Barcelona, Catalonia, Jiménez had a stint with local giants FC Barcelona's third team to kickstart his senior career. He made his professional debut with neighbours UE Figueres on loan, being backup then first-choice for two Segunda División seasons. In 1992, Jiménez moved to Rayo Vallecano after terminating his previous contract with Real Zaragoza. Initially a backup to Wilfred Agbonavbare, he benefitted from an injury to the Nigerian in the second round to make his La Liga debut against CD Logroñés, although he finished the campaign on the bench again. The following year, Jiménez accompanied coach José Antonio Camacho to RCD Espanyol, then in the second level. He was an undisputed starter during his six-year spell, winning the Ricardo Zamora Trophy in his first season, qualifying for the UEFA Cup immediately afterwards and amassing nearly 300 overall official appearances. Jiménez signed for Atlético Madrid in 1999, being highly unsuccessful there during three years. Barred by José Francisco Molina in his first season, the team from the capital were also relegated; furthermore, in that year's Copa del Rey final, against former side Espanyol, he was stripped off the ball by former teammate Raúl Tamudo's head for the final 1–2. Jiménez again regained first-choice status at Elche CF, but returned to the top flight and Espanyol in January 2003 when new boss Javier Clemente requested his signing. At the end of the following campaign, he retired from the game at almost 34; he stayed connected with the latter in directorial capacities, leaving in March 2006 when director of football Cristóbal Parralo also resigned. Jiménez served his first coaching spell also in Catalonia, as assistant in Girona FC. In May 2009 he returned to the club as goalkeeper's coach and, two years later, signed with Espanyol as assistant to Mauricio Pochettino; the pair linked up again in January 2013, after the latter was appointed at Southampton. In late May 2014, both Pochettino and Jiménez signed for another team in the Premier League, Tottenham Hotspur. Jiménez had not yet played top level football when he was summoned by coach Vicente Miera to the 1992 Summer Olympics, in local Barcelona. He beat competition from Santiago Cañizares, until then the starter, and played all the matches and minutes "en route" to the gold medal. Additionally, Jiménez won three caps for the full side during one year, his first one being offered by Camacho, a friendly with Italy on 18 November 1998 (2–2, in Salerno). He seemed poised to be called as third-choice for UEFA Euro 2000, but 19-year-old Iker Casillas was chosen instead. Espanyol Atlético Madrid Spain U23 

HMS "Alligator" was a 28-gun "Enterprise"-class sixth rate frigate of the Royal Navy. She was originally ordered during the American War of Independence but was completed too late to see service during the conflict. Instead she had an active career during the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars. Commissioned during the last few years of peace prior to the outbreak of war with France, "Alligator" served in British waters, making trips as far afield as the Mediterranean and the North American coast. During the period of conflict that began in 1793, "Alligator" spent a considerable amount of time in the West Indies under a number of commanders, and was effective in anti-privateer operations. Despite this she was laid up for a period starting in 1795, and was reduced to a 16-gun troopship in 1800. Further service followed in the West Indies, supporting the fleet and army movements around the islands, and taking part in the capture of several French frigates. She was again laid up, and as the end of hostilities approached, was deemed surplus and was sold in 1814. "Alligator" was one of the third batch of "Enterprise"-class ships to be ordered by the Admiralty, with the contract to build her being awarded to Philemon Jacobs, of Sandgate on 7 May 1782. She was laid down there in December 1782 and launched on 18 April 1787. With there being no immediate need for a large number of ships in the navy after the end of the war with America, "Alligator" was gradually completed between 20 April 1787 and 18 July 1790, at first at Deptford Dockyard and then at the civilian yards of Randall & Co, at Rotherhithe. She cost a total of £2,771 with £4,330 spent on fitting costs and expenses incurred at Deptford. She commissioned under her first commander, Captain Isaac Coffin in June 1790. Coffin commissioned "Alligator" during the period of tensions known as the Spanish Armament and commanded her over the three years leading up to the outbreak of war with Revolutionary France. At one point, while "Alligator" was anchored at the Nore, one of her crew fell overboard. Coffin jumped into the water to rescue him, and succeeded in recovering the man before he drowned, but in doing so experienced a serious rupture while carrying out the rescue, that would dog him in later life. From the Nore Coffin moved to Spithead, and then to Ceuta, where "Alligator" briefly carried the flag of Admiral Philip Cosby. Superseded by the arrival of , "Alligator" was sent to cruise off Western Ireland. In 1792 Coffin sailed to Canada and returned carrying Lord Dorchester. "Alligator" then underwent a refit at Deptford for £2,895 and recommissioned in December 1792. From February 1793 her commander was Captain William Afleck, who served briefly in the North Sea, achieving success against French privateers in the region. On 12 February 1793 he captured the "Sans Peur", followed by the "Prend Tout" on 21 February. Afleck left Britain bound for the Leeward Islands on 18 March 1793. He stopped at Halifax, where the schooner joined him. From there they sailed, with three transports carrying an artillery detachment and 310 troops primarily from the 4th Regiment of Foot, all under the command of Brigadier General James Ogilvie, to St Pierre and Miquelon on 7 May. They captured Saint Pierre on 14 May without firing a shot. They also captured 18 small vessels carrying fish, and two American schooners with provisions and naval stores. joined them a day later and then sailed to Miquelon to complete the conquest. Prize money for the capture of the islands was paid in October 1796. On 11 December 1793, "Alligator" captured the French ship "Triomphant" in St Marks Bay, in the island of Hispaniola. Next, "Alligator" captured the French 14-gun "Liberté" near Jamaica on 28 March 1794. On 14 June, "Alligator" was among the vessels that participated in the capture of Port-au-Prince. In October that year command passed to Captain Thomas Surridge. Captain Thomas Afleck succeeded Surridgein January 1795, and paid "Alligator" off the following month. "Alligator" was laid up at Portsmouth for five years, until being refitted there as a 16-gun troopship between February and March 1800. She was recommissioned in February under Captain George Bowen, under whom she took part in operations off Egypt during the French campaign there. While supporting the landing of troops in Abu Qir Bay had one man killed and three wounded. On 17 July she recaptured the "Anchor". Because "Alligator" served in the navy's Egyptian campaign between 8 March 1801 and 2 September, her officers and crew qualified for the clasp "Egypt" to the Naval General Service Medal that the Admiralty authorised in 1850 to all surviving claimants. Captain Philip Beaver took over command in May 1802. He remained "Alligator"s captain until she was recommissioned in May the following year under Commander Richardson. In April 1803, however, "Alligator" was sailing from Gibraltar to Britain in company with and the store ship "Prevoyante" when they sighted two French ships of the line off Cape St. Vincent. The French ships veered off rather than engage the British vessels. Later that year "Alligator" went out to the Leeward Islands and on 27 September was one of a number of ships that captured the 18-gun Dutch ship at Demerara. Commander Robert Henderson was in command between 1804 and 1805, during which time "Alligator" was one of several ships to chase down and capture the 32-gun "Proserpine" at Surinam on 6 May 1804. "Alligator" formed part of Commodore Samuel Hood's squadron at the capture of Surinam River in 1804. The squadron consisted of Hood's flagship , "Pandour", , , , "Drake", and transports carrying 2000 troops under Brigadier-General Sir Charles Green. Both British and Dutch casualties were light. In November, "Alligator" recaptured from a French privateer the Danish brig "Hoff", which was carrying a cargo of slaves. On 24 June 1805, "Alligator" captured the Spanish brig "Santo Chritle", which was carrying brandy from Spain to Havanna. Henderson was succeeded by Commander Augustus Collier in 1806, who returned her to the Leeward Islands. There in March 1806 she came under the command of Captain Hugh Pigot. Captain Robert Bell Campbell replaced Pigot from 1807. Campbell returned "Alligator" to Britain, where she was laid up at Plymouth in April 1807. She was offered for sale there on 21 July 1814 as the Napoleonic Wars drew to a close. She was sold that day for the sum of £1,760. Notes Citations References 

Gambling City () is a 1975 Italian "poliziotteschi" film by Sergio Martino. It stars Luc Merenda, Enrico Maria Salerno, Dayle Haddon and Corrado Pani. "Gambling City" is one of several European heist films produced in response to the popular success of American films in the genre like The Sting (1973). The film features many of the genre's standard conventions, including a Byronic hero who acts as a social bandit by practicing confidence tricks, the hero's forbidden love with a socially repressed damsel in distress (who may or may not exhibit facets of the femme fatale) and a morally corrupt dandy as villain and the hero's foil. The film was co-written by Martino and Ernesto Gastaldi, and produced by Luciano Martino. "Gambling City's" story centers on the exploits of master poker player and card sharp Luca Altieri (Merenda); Altieri begins working for underground illegal gambling kingpin "The President" after running a scam at a high-stakes poker table in The President's casino; soon after entering The President's employ, however, Altieri enters into a violent competition with The President's hot-tempered, self-entitled son and heir, Corrado (Pani), for the hand of Corrado's girlfriend, Maria Luisa (Haddon). "Gambling City" opens with Altieri entering an illegal gambling parlor in Milan and taking a seat beside several tuxedoed patrons at its high-roller table. In contrast to his slickly attired opponents Altieri is dressed in a threadbare cardigan and slacks and has a carnation in his lapel. Noticing the newcomer's obvious lack of means at a table where a single chip is worth 10,000 lira, one player asks Altieri if he has enough money to back his bets. To this Altieri responds, "Win or bust." Altieri then proceeds to execute his scam by initially pretending to be a poker novice. He fumbles his cards and requests a re-deal despite his having four-of-a-kind queens, explaining that he doesn't trust receiving such a strong hand so early. Within minutes he has fleeced his fellow players, and while waiting to make his exit via elevator, he reveals his scheme to a security guard standing beside him. In response, the security guard tells Altieri the elevator is not an exit at all and escorts the scamp into it. They then take the elevator to the casino's basement where Altieri meets The President, Corrado and Maria Luisa. According to Roberto Curti, Martino's contributions to the scrip were "just nominal". Ernesto Gastaldi stated that he "wrote the script with Enrico Maria Salerno in mind as theboss of a sharp - and not just violent - criminal organization which has succession problem when the son shows he's not cut from the same cloth as his father." Gastaldi considers the script he wrote to be one of his best efforts, but stated that "I believe the actors were very good on this film, improving upon a story that, although not very original, was rather different from crime films of that era." "Gambling City" was shot at Dear Studios in Rome and on location in Milan and Nice. "Gambling City" was released on January 23, 1975 in Italy where it was distributed by Medusa. The film grossed a total of 777,334,540 Italian lire on its theatrical run. The film released on Region 0 NTSC DVD by NoShame films in 2005 as part of the "Sergio Martino Collection." The DVD is currently out-of-print. "Gambling City" received little attention in the European or American press at its release, but experienced a revival in interest when now-defunct Italian cult-film company NoShame Films re-released it on DVD in 2005. At the time of its re-release New York Times reviewer Dave Kehr noted the "powerful, rhythmic sense of violence" the film shares with other Martino films. But Kehr's review primarily focused on the film as an early example of Martino's talents. Kehr praised the absolute lack of sentimentality displayed by a director who would go on to make over 50 feature-length films, including spaghetti westerns like A Man Called Blade (1977) and science-fiction fantasies like "2019: After the Fall of New York" (1983). Since the film's release on DVD, however, no other mainstream critics have commented on it, and what attention it has received from the blogosphere has been mostly negative. TwitchFilm.net reviewer "logboy" called it "a fairly odd experience," but qualified his disparagement with, "It has its saving graces in amount substantial enough to make it an interesting experience in many isolated regards." And Gambling City critic Matt Hwang called the film's score "something between the distorted wind-up chime of a broken Jack-in-the-Box and the Merry-go-Round accordion."

Mouse Wreckers is a 1949 Warner Bros. "Looney Tunes" short directed by Chuck Jones, written by Michael Maltese and starring Hubie and Bertie in their first pairing with the redesigned Claude Cat (an early, primordial version of the cat appeared in 1943's "The Aristo-Cat"). The cartoon was released on April 23, 1949. The short centers around Hubie and Bertie's attempts to move into a new home by chasing Claude out of the house. Mel Blanc voices Bertie and an uncredited Stan Freberg voices Hubie. The title is a pun on "house wrecker" or "home wrecker", where a house is destroyed, often figuratively, by a single person. "Mouse Wreckers" was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film for 1948, but lost to "The Little Orphan", a "Tom and Jerry" cartoon which was the fifth Oscar (of seven) given to the cat and mouse team. The cartoon was loosely remade as "Gopher Broke" in 1958 (with the Goofy Gophers and the Barnyard Dawg), and later as the "Tom and Jerry" cartoon "The Year of the Mouse" in 1965 (also written by Maltese and directed by co-writer Jones). Scouting out a new home, Hubie calls over Bertie, who begins to gaze into it before Hubie slaps Bertie to make him realize that before they can move in, the cat Claude, who has an award for Best Mouser - 1948 (along with other mouser awards), must be removed first. Realizing that the task may not be easy, Hubie comes up with several ways to chase Claude out, all of which are designed to drive him crazy, having Bertie do each of the tricks. First, Hubie lowers Bertie down the chimney on a fishing line. At the bottom of the chimney, Bertie grabs a piece of wood, smacks Claude in the head with it, and is then quickly yanked back up the chimney. When Claude just goes back to sleep, unable to figure out what happened, Bertie is lowered again, pumping air into Claude. When Bertie is yanked back up the chimney and the pump is released, Claude ends up flying all over the living room, hitting all of the walls and ceiling before landing hard on the pillow on which he was resting. Claude then takes the bottle of catnip he had hidden in an overhead lamp, tosses it out the window, and inaudibly mutters the Pledge of Sobriety. With the logs removed from the fireplace, Hubie lowers Bertie and a dog (resembling Hector the Bulldog) in a doghouse down the chimney. While the dog is sleeping, Bertie pulls out the dog's lower lip such that it snaps back on him, but not before Bertie is pulled back up the chimney. Seeing only Claude, the dog viciously beats up Claude before returning to the doghouse, with the doghouse then yanked up the chimney. Completely nerve-wracked as a result of the beating, Claude then runs to the bathroom to take a dose of nerve tonic. While Claude is in the bathroom, Bertie then inserts a lit firecracker into Claude's pillow, which blows up after he returns to it. When Claude finds his arm has feathers, he frantically runs back to the bathroom to check himself, all the while the feathers fly off him when he runs. Claude finds himself without any feathers on and on his arm, then nervously gulps down the remainder of the nerve tonic. Next, Bertie returns down the chimney and runs a piece of string throughout the house, zig-zags through piles of dishes, out of it into a water catch drain, down a ladder, and then back into the house with the other end of the string attached to a rock on top of the chimney. Once Bertie ties the end of the string to Claude's tail, Hubie tosses the rock down the other side of the chimney, which sends Claude flying throughout the house, out of it and back into it, and eventually slamming him into a trash can lid, which begins to drive Claude crazy by flicking his lips up and down. Claude then reads ""Psychology of Dreams"" by Sigmund Fried for advice on dealing with what Claude thinks are bad dreams. When Claude falls asleep, Bertie places earmuffs over his ears, while Hubie and Bertie work on nailing everything that would be in front of Claude that was on the floor in the living room to the ceiling, and painting the ceiling like the floor and vice versa. When Claude wakes up, he sees this and thinks he is on the ceiling (when he is really on the floor) and jumps up to what he thinks is the floor (which is really the ceiling). Claude is surprised when he grabs a bottle of nerve tonic, only to open it and see it "rise" to the floor. Claude then becomes confused when he enters into the kitchen, where everything is still right-side up. Further driving Claude mad is when he looks out one window where an illusion is given to make Claude think he is upside down (it is actually a painting turned upside down and held by the mice), and then looks out another to make him think he is sideways (another painting turned sideways and also held by the mice), and then out a third to make him believe that the house is under water (in actuality, there is a fish tank on a small ladder outside that window). Finally broken, Claude runs, screaming, from the house and hides in a nearby tree, trembling in the leaves. Having accomplished their mission, Hubie and Bertie return down the fireplace and roast cheese over an open fire as the cartoon fades out.

Robert Greene (born May 14, 1959) is an American author known for his books on strategy, power, and seduction. He has written six international bestsellers: "The 48 Laws of Power", "The Art of Seduction", "The 33 Strategies of War", "The 50th Law" (with rapper 50 Cent), "Mastery", and "The Laws of Human Nature". The younger son of Jewish parents, Greene grew up in Los Angeles and attended the University of California, Berkeley before finishing his degree at the University of Wisconsin-Madison with a B.A. in classical studies. Before becoming an author, Greene estimates that he worked 80 jobs, including as a construction worker, translator, magazine editor, and Hollywood movie writer. In 1995, Greene worked as a writer at Fabrica, an art and media school in Italy, and met a book packager named Joost Elffers. Greene pitched a book about power to Elffers and wrote a treatment which eventually became "The 48 Laws of Power". He would note this as the turning point of his life. Greene's first book, "The 48 Laws of Power", first published in 1998, is a practical guide for anyone who wants power, observes power, or wants to arm themselves against power. The laws are a distillation of 3,000 years in the history of power, drawing on the lives of strategists and historical figures like Niccolò Machiavelli, Sun Tzu, Haile Selassie I, Carl von Clausewitz, Queen Elizabeth I, Henry Kissinger, and P.T. Barnum. Each law has its own chapter, complete with a "transgression of the law," "observance of the law," and/or a "reversal." "The 48 Laws of Power" has sold more than 1.2 million copies. It is popular with well-known rappers, entrepreneurs, celebrities, athletes and actors including 50 Cent, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Busta Rhymes, Ludacris, DJ Premier, Drake, Dov Charney, Brian Grazer, Andrew Bynum, Chris Bosh, Michael Jackson, Courtney Love and Will Smith. The laws too pose more reflection on understanding the status quo and forwarding interests with a higher purpose and set of values in mind, to make your accomplishments seem effortless is a key point of a leader understanding their approval rating thus acting according to that basis. Greene's second book, "The Art of Seduction", was published in 2001. The book profiles the nine types of seducers (e.g. The Rake, The Siren, and The Charmer) and details aspects of attraction, authenticity, storytelling, and negotiation. Greene uses examples from historical figures such as Cleopatra, Giacomo Casanova, Duke Ellington and John F. Kennedy to support the psychology behind seduction. "The Art of Seduction" is mentioned in Neil Strauss' book as a recommended book in the seduction community. It has sold more than 500,000 copies. "The 33 Strategies of War" is the third book by Greene and was published in 2007. The book is divided into five parts: Self-Directed Warfare, Organizational (Team) Warfare, Defensive Warfare, Offensive Warfare and Unconventional (Dirty) Warfare. The book is a guide to the campaign of everyday life and distills military wisdom from historical figures like Napoleon Bonaparte, Sun Tzu, Alfred Hitchcock, Alexander the Great and Margaret Thatcher. "The Sunday Times" called the book "an excellent toolkit for dealing with business and relationships," and "The Independent" claims that Greene is "setting himself up as a modern-day Machiavelli" but that "it is never clear whether he really believes what he writes or whether it is just his shtick, an instrument of his will to shift £20 hardbacks." NBA player Chris Bosh stated that his favorite book is "The 33 Strategies of War". It has sold more than 200,000 copies. "The 50th Law" is the fourth book by Greene—written collaboratively with rapper 50 Cent—and was published in 2009. The book mixes talk of strategy and fearlessness by supplementing anecdotes from 50 Cent's rise as both a young urban hustler and as an up-and-coming musician with lessons from various historical figures. Each of the 10 chapters in the book explains a factor of fearlessness and begins by telling how 50 learned this "Fearless Philosophy" in Southside Queens. The book debuted at #5 on "The New York Times" Bestseller list and was a USA Today bestseller. Greene's fifth book, "Mastery", was released on November 13, 2012. "Mastery" examines the lives of both historical and contemporary figures such as Charles Darwin, Paul Graham, the Wright Brothers, Benjamin Franklin, Thomas Edison, and Mozart, and distills the traits and universal ingredients that made them masters. The book is divided into six sections, each focusing on essential lessons and strategies on the path to Mastery. "Mastery" reached #6 on "The New York Times" Bestseller list and was featured in "CNN Money", "The Huffington Post", "The New York Times", "Business Insider", "Forbes", "Management Today", and "Fast Company". Greene's sixth book, " The Laws of Human Nature ", was released in October 2018. The book examines people's conscious and unconscious drives, motivations, and cognitive biases. "The 48 Laws of Power" has been referenced in songs by Jay Z, Kanye West, and Drake. Busta Rhymes used "The 48 Laws of Power" to deal with problematic movie producers. Greene has claimed former Cuban President Fidel Castro had also read the book. The "48 Laws of Power" is one of the most requested books in American prison libraries. Several American prisons have banned "The 48 Laws of Power" and "The 33 Strategies of War". Greene's books are sometimes described as manipulative and amoral. "The Sunday Times" noted that "The 48 Laws of Power" has become the "Hollywood back-stabber's bible" and that although the book is reportedly used by some business executives, it is difficult to find people who publicly acknowledge its influence because of the book's controversial nature. Greene responds to this sentiment by stating, "These laws… people might say, 'Oh they're wicked', but they're practiced day in and day out by businesspeople. You're always trying to get rid of your competition and it can be pretty bloodthirsty, and that's just the reality." Greene's work has been featured in "The New York Times", "USA Today", CNN, "The New Yorker", "Newsweek", the "Los Angeles Times", "Forbes", "Huffington Post", "Business Week", "Business Insider", "Fast Company", "Slate", and "XXL". Greene has also appeared on "The Today Show", CNBC, ABC, and MTV News. Greene lives in Los Angeles with his girlfriend Anna Biller, who is a filmmaker. Greene can speak five languages and is a student of Zen Buddhism. He is an avid swimmer and mountain biker. Greene suffered a serious stroke before launching his new book "The Laws of Human Nature" in 2018. It was caused by a blood clot in his neck and has currently left him without the use of his left hand and leg.

It is also a terminal station of the Fukui Railway Fukubu Line and is 20.9 kilometers from the opposing terminal at . The station consists of one side platform and one island platform connected by a level crossing. The station is staffed. Tawaramachi Station was opened on April 1, 1937 as a station on the Mikuni Awara Electric Railway. On September 1, 1942 the Keifuku Electric Railway merged with Mikuni Awara Electric Railway. Operations were halted from April 20, 1944. The station reopened on November 27, 1950, and operations were expanded when the station became a terminus of the Fukui Railway Fukubu Line. On June 25, 2001 the Keifuku Electric Railroad portion of the station closed, and reopened again on July 20, 2003 as an Echizen Railway station. Tawaramachi Station is just to the west of Phoenix-dōri (Prefectural Route 30). Since the University of Fukui's Bunkyō Campus, Hokuriku High School, Fujishima High School and many other educational institutions are located in the vicinity, students are a common sight in mornings and evenings.

Petit Albert (English: "Lesser Albert") is an 18th-century grimoire of natural and cabalistic magic. The "Petit Albert" is possibly inspired by the writings of Albertus Parvus Lucius (the Lesser Albert.) Brought down to the smallest hamlets in the saddlebags of peddlers, it represents a phenomenal publishing success, despite its association with "devil worshippers"—or rather thanks to it. It is associated with a second work, the "Grand Albert". It is a composite, even heterogeneous work, and perhaps a bric-a-brac, collecting texts of unequal value written by (or attributed to) various authors; most of these authors are anonymous, but some are notable such as Cardano and Paracelsus. It is a relatively old text, in which even the attribution to Albertus Magnus is dubious. Coupled with the fact that it quotes from so many later sources, this makes it an ethnological document of the first order. The Little Albert is generally mentioned at the same time as the Grand Albert, another grimoire. The Little Albert, however, is neither a summary nor an abridged version of the Grand Albert; it is a separate text, as can be seen in a comparison of the two works by Claude Seignolle in a French work titled, "Les Évangiles du Diable" (in English: The Gospels of the Devil). The author of these two works, or at least the Grand Albert, is in theory Albertus Magnus, born about 1193, theologian, Sorbonne University professor. "Albertus Magnus" (or, in English, literally, "Albert the Great") was canonized. The Place Maubert (etymologically Place of the "Master Albert") in Paris is named after him. The text of "Secrets merveilleux de la magie naturelle et cabalistique du Petit Albert" that was published by "Chez les Heritiers Beringos" in 1752 specifically credits authorship to "Alberti Parvi Lucii". In Tarl Warwick's 2016 English translation, the warning to the reader says: "Here is a new edition of the Wonderful Natural Secrets of the Little Albert, known in Latin by the title Libellus Alberti Parvi Lucii of mirabilibus Arcanis naturae: the author was one of those noble and wise men accused of witchery by the ignorant masses; (it was formerly the fate of all the great minds who possessed something extraordinary in science, as they were treated like magicians.)" The writings of "Master Albert" were obviously not printed in his day, as he died (in 1280) before the invention of the printing press (circa 1440). The earliest known edition appeared in France in 1706 and was published by "Chez les Heritiers Beringos" in Lyon, which represents a gap of more than 400 years between the estimated date of writing and that of printing, a range of time that opens up many possibilities for the evolution of the text. In fact, the publishing company that printed it was fictional. According to the historian Owen Davies, to publish controversial and even illegal grimoires under the "Chez les Heritiers Beringos" was a common tactic in the 18th and 19th centuries, as grimoires became increasingly censored by the Catholic Church. The location of the publisher was described as being at the "sign of Agrippa." The fact that the Big and the Little Albert are named after Albertus Magnus is a claim that should not be taken literally. In spite of this article's name, it is extremely important to note that the text actually contains references known to be by authors posterior to the Master Albert, like Paracelsus, very largely quoted. Furthermore, there are mentions of events which occurred after the time of the Master Albert. By placing themselves under the aegis of Albert the Great, these works seek recognition and legitimacy. This practice of collective attribution to one great person in history was common practice in the time of the first printing of the Petit Albert. It is not comparable to modern falsification or plagiarism. Far from it, and far from any motive of willful deceit, it was regarded as a way to pay homage while also giving cover to the writers of controversial topics. From 1850, the Grand and the Petit Albert are published under the following titles: These three works were collected in a grand three-volume work published in Paris in the 1860s, entitled "Le Grande et Veritable Science Cabalistique". The reaction of the Catholic Church in the 19th and early 20th centuries was negative. The Church held that the combination of the two "Alberts" was itself a form of black magic. So those who read them, did so in secret, hid them under a beam in the attic, and sometimes wondered which of the neighbors could own a copy. Even some of those who were good Christians tried to bless the book in secret by hiding it under the tablecloth of the altar. Priests knew about this practice. They inspected the possible hiding places before mass and made the "Albert" disappear if they found one. Legends about the Albert flourished. It was said that the devil tries to take back his books and that destroying an Albert was too dangerous for an individual to accomplish safely. With the goals of safety and salvation in mind, the presence of an Albert should be confided to a priest. The attitude of the Church after the French Revolution contrasts with the fact that the book had a long editorial life by no means clandestine since successive editions were published in Lyon under the Ancien Régime, and even before the Age of Enlightenment, when the Church had every latitude to ban it. The book was indirectly censored from 1793 to 1815 when peddling literature was prohibited; evidently the Church was not involved in this decision. The two Alberts, sold by peddling and inseparable from the Almanac (with astrological calendar, another great success of the popular edition) made the fortune of their publishers, since, according to Seignolle, it sold 400,000 a year in the Belgian Ardennes alone. This means that everyone had one, even if everyone pretended to be indignant at the existence of these books. The profile of the reader was not that of the sorcerer, but that of a man of the world, who at the time was a farmer, and who was in general deeply Christian. This success is all the more remarkable because these books were of no use to the peasant. The formulas were not very practical. Even the cooking recipes (different compositions of spicy wine) require many expensive ingredients, difficult to identify and usually absent from French villages. The intended audience occupied the whole social spectrum. The hand of glory, for example, was an instrument appreciated by burglars. The soap recipes and the eau de toilette, which include many expensive ingredients from around the world, are probably those of the apothecaries of the ladies of the Court. "Copies of Le Petit Albert have been located among the 19th century French peasantry, the Hoodoo practitioners of New Orleans, and the Obeah men of the French West Indies." The Petit Albert became a meme. "To say one had the Petit Albert was shorthand for saying one was deep in magic." Other parts of the book represent the presentation of alchemical or cabalist theories whose origin is attributed mainly to Paracelsus. These include talismans in accordance with cabalist methods: how to make gold artificially, for example, and how to dissolve gold. Other how to's include how to turn lead into gold, how to create fake money using tin, how to use borax to melt gold, and how to create imitation pearls.

Wissam Khodur (), better known as Eslam Jawaad (), is a rapper of Lebanese-Syrian origin. His debut album, "The Mammoth Tusk", was released in 2009. The album was considered an international advancement for local Arabic hip-hop as it featured support from a number of high-profile acts including Damon Albarn (Gorillaz/Blur), De La Soul, The Rza / Gza / Cilvaringz (Wu-Tang Clan), Focus... (Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment), Rude Jude / Lord Sear (Shade 45), and 'Arap' band-mate Shadia Mansour. Jawaad's presence within the music industry is spread out across both the MENA region and Internationally. In addition to his solo career, Jawaad is a founding member of the Arab Hip-Hop Collective known as 'Arap', which consisted of - in addition to himself- Mohalim, Cilvaringz, Ledr P, and Shadia Mansour. The last members to officially join Arap were The Narcicyst, DJ Vanz and DJ Lady S, though they never recorded with the group. Associated acts included Malikah, DJ Lethal Skillz, RGB, L'Hamorabi, Rasta Pharaoh, and Miskeena. Salah Edin, who founded the group with Eslam and Cilvaringz, left the group in 2009, and the group itself ceased to record soon after. Though the band never released a studio album, the momentum they gave the Arab hip-hop movement through their tours and limited releases was one of the most anticipated and important developments for the genre. Jawaad's first international tour was with Wu-Tang Killa Beez, as he was brought into that fold by his longtime associate, partner and manager Cilvaringz. It was this that led to his collaboration with Rza and Gza on his album song 'So Real' ft. Shadia Mansour. His most recent endeavor with Wu-Tang is his Co-Executive Producer credits on the single-copy, art piece - Wu-Tang Clan album "Once Upon A Time in Shaolin", which made it into the Guinness Book of Records, as most valuable album. In addition to this, Jawaad also featured on Cilvaringz Album, "I". He has also toured with a number of other notable acts including Gorillaz, The Good The Bad and The Queen, Fun-da-mental, and Africa Express. He is an avid supporter of MENA region music and uses his influence to promote various artists from the region, while also managing acts including Mais Harb and Layali Project which he successfully signed onto Universal Music. Jawaad was instrumental in bringing long time friend and musical collaborator Damon Albarn to Syria to record with the Syrian National Orchestra for Arabic Music, and recordings from these sessions made it onto the Gorillaz album 'Plastic Beach', with the Orchestra alongside Albarn and Jawaad eventually touring under the Africa Express banner in 2016 across major festivals including Glastonbury and Roskilde. Jawaad also played an integral role in promoting Arab artists internationally Jawaad is father of three children and currently resides in the Dubai. After working as Executive Director for Global Gumbo Group, an LA and Dubai based company founded by Quincy Jones, he is currently Spotifys' Head of Artist & Label Marketing across the Middle East and North Africa. He continues to consult within the industry, and has lectured at Cambridge University's Judge Business School. His song "Pivot Widdit" was used in the Dubai film "City of Life", and "Siasa" in Hollywood blockbuster "Rendition".

Saint-Pierre-du-Mont Airfield is an abandoned World War II military airfield which is located in the Calvados department in the Normandy region in northern France. It was one of the many instrumental airfields used to defeat Adolf Hitler's Axis powers in World War II. Located just north of Saint-Pierre-du-Mont along the English Channel coast, it was a United States Army Air Force temporary airfield established shortly after the D-Day landings in France. The airfield was one of the first established in the liberated area of Normandy, being constructed by the IX Engineering Command, 834th Engineer Aviation Battalion. Known as Advanced Landing Ground "A-1", the airfield consisted of a single Square-Mesh Track runway. In addition, with tents were used for billeting and also for support facilities; an access road was built to the existing road infrastructure; a dump for supplies, ammunition, and gasoline drums, along with a drinkable water and minimal electrical grid for communications and station lighting. Construction of the airfield began on 7 June, the day after the initial invasion, and was completed on 8 June at 1800 hrs The airfield was completed only 2 days after the D-Day landings in France. It was pressed into service as Emergency Landing Strip 1 (ELS A-1) with a untracked (grass/dirt) runway. It served only small observation aircraft at that time. Just over 24 hours later (18:45) it had been upgraded from a Refuelling and Rearming Strip (RRS A-1) to an Advanced Landing Ground (ALG A-1), able to handle aircraft up to the C-47 transport. From 10 June 1944 an RAF Ames Type 15 GCI radar site became active at the airfield, the only survivor of three that were accidentally sent to the Normandy beaches on D-Day, instead of D-Day+3 of the invasion. After his day trip to Normandy on June 12, General "Hap" Arnold, USAAF commander, returned to the UK from A-1. Combat units stationed at the airfield were the 366th Fighter Group, which based P-47 Thunderbolt fighters at the field from 13 June through 5 September 1944. The 401st Fighter Squadron (9D), [370th Fighter Group] based P-38 Lighting fighters [note bottom center of accompanying airfield photograph] from July - August 1944. It also housed the 2d Platoon of the 1st Air Force Clearing Station, which had landed at Omaha Beach on 16 June. The medical unit set up a field hospital just off base, which by that time would still occasionally receive incoming enemy fire, as the front line was not far away. The platoon consisted of 4 Medical Officers, 1 Dental Officer, 1 Medical Administrative Officer, 6 (female) Nurses, and 57 Enlisted Men. The fighter aircraft flew support missions during the Allied invasion of Normandy, patrolling roads in front of the beachhead; strafing German military vehicles and dropping bombs on gun emplacements, anti-aircraft artillery and concentrations of German troops when spotted. In addition to the fighters, elements of the 416th and 322d Bomb Groups dispatched B-26 Marauder medium bombers from their bases in England to Saint-Pierre-du-Mont to attack German strong points in Normandy during the initial battles around Saint-Lô After the Americans moved east into Central France with the advancing Allied Armies, the airfield was left un-garrisoned and used for resupply and casualty evacuation. It was closed on 5 September 1944. After its closure by the Americans, the airfield was dismantled in September 1944 and the land returned to agricultural use. Today there is little or no physical evidence of its existence or its location. There is a monument to the A-1 Airfield north of the D514, just to the north of Les Bergeries.

Chrysina gloriosa is a species of scarab whose common names are glorious beetle and glorious scarab. The adults are long and are bright green with silver stripes on the elytra. These iridescent stripes on the cuticle of the elytra are a result of cholesteric liquid crystal organization of chitin molecules. The differences in color are a result of the microscopic structure of each section, with green reflected from cusp-like structures and silver reflected from flat layers parallel to the surface of the elytra. As established through Mueller matrix spectroscopic ellipsometry, the optical properties change with the incidence angle of the propagating light. The polygonal cells in the green stripes generate self-healing Bessel beams. The adults eat juniper leaves at a high elevation and are able to camouflage by blending in with plants. The species is sometimes incorrectly thought to be endangered, but has never been listed either in the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species or under the United States Endangered Species Act. An invalid synonym used to be "Plusiotis gloriosa". 

Dobiel, also Dubbiel ("bear-god"), was the guardian angel of Ancient Persia. According to the Talmud, Dobiel was also one of the special accusers of Israel, and once officiated in Heaven for 21 days as a proxy for Gabriel when the latter (over whom Dobiel scored a victory) was in temporary disgrace for taking pity on the Israelites when God was angry with them and convincing the Babylonians to drive them from Babylon rather than kill them. After coming to power in Heaven, Dobiel set about helping the Persian people at the expense of every other nation. The legend states that all of the 70 or 72 tutelary or guardian angels of nations (except Michael, protector of Israel) became corrupted through national bias. 

The Ridgeland–Oak Park Historic District is a historic district in Oak Park, Illinois that was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1983. It includes 1558 contributing buildings over . The district includes the George W. Smith House, an early example of Frank Lloyd Wright's work as a contributing property. The house is one of two Frank Lloyd Wright designed buildings within the Ridgeland Historic District and the only residential home; the other structure is the Unity Temple. Otherwise, the historic district lacks examples of Wright's full-fledged Prairie style that are found in abundance in the nearby Frank Lloyd Wright-Prairie School of Architecture Historic District. The district contains many buildings of merit, including the Oak Park Post Office on Lake Street, designed in 1933 by Charles E. White, Jr. and his partner Bertram A. Weber, in 1933, and the Art Deco Medical Arts Building, designed by Oak Park architect Roy J. Hotchkiss.

Gowkhall (for a period known as Balclune) is a hamlet in Fife Scotland, 3.6 miles (5.794 km) west of Dunfermline. The nearest village of size is Carnock 0.8 miles (1.287 km) to the west, which has a church and primary school. To the south there is the Dean Woods past which is the village of Crossford, which has two hotels and businesses. Gowkhall seems to have had at least two names in the past. In the William Roy Military Survey maps of Scotland 1747-55 the village does not appear to be marked. However in John Ainslie' mapping of Fife in 1775 it is, showing the large Clunie estate to immediate East of the village. In the later John Thomson's Atlas of Scotland 1832 it is clearly marked as Gowkhall, with the centre of the village being where the modern day junction between Clune Road and Dean Ridge occurs. However, by the Ordnance Survey map of 1898 the village is known as Balclune with no mention of Gowkhall, the name Gowkhall returns in the next (3rd) edition of the Ordnance Survey Maps 1903. The hamlet of Gowkhall comes under the authority of the Carnock and Gowkhall Community Council making use of the primary school in Carnock. No public amenities exist in Gowkhall itself. Gowkhall historically is considered to have resided in the Lands of Clune, which in modern terms refers to the Wester Clune Farm. The Clune lands were originally in the barony of Pittencrieff and the parish of Dunfermline. The lands were latterly transferred into the parish of Carnock. References have been found back to 14 February 1441: The name Clune is repeatedly associated, through various tales, with a Clunic Monk, or Knight Templar who used to reside in the area. One reference refers to unspecified sources telling that the Knight was known to wear "black frock, a pelisse, a hood of lamb's wool, red hose, a white woollen tunic, and black scapular - the latter sometimes white, and at other times red.". The fables tell of this clunic being "hospitable to strangers, fed the hungry, clothed the naked, and gave drink to those who were athirst, and performed his duty.". Certainly the name Clunie has persisted with the area and continues to this day, the lands now consider to be Wester Clune Farm used to reside in the Clunie Estate, shown in maps of 1776. Gowkhall officially broke with the Clune Estate on 22 October 1747 when Professor Erskine of Carnock acquired from James Henderson of Clune "the Room of land of the lands of Clune called Gowkhall" (G.R.S. 69) Gowkhall is reputed to have been a very attractive village in the early days and a one time native of the village is known to have been John Millar who is known to have spent the majority of his life teaching in London at a "Ragged School". Some lines of poetry are associated with him. Gowkhall did at one time boast its own pub, called the Bamboo Inn currently known as Bamboo Cottage. This was closed down due to a "fatal incident" in the late 19th century resulting the licensee losing his license. The name Bamboo Inn is of unknown origin and a local bridge is also referred to as Bamboo Bridge. One source refers to the name "Bambow" in place of Bamboo, but no reference is provided to indicate if this was the original form. Gowkhall used to be famed for the number of wells that had been sunk in the village and in the early 19th century consisted mainly of hand weaving cottages. These cottages were demolished in the late 19th century and the stones used to build the impressive wall surrounding Luscar House, the Luskar Dyke. A curling pond was also located in Gowkhall, on the western edge. Reports suggest the access steps up to the road through the dyke still exist. The grounds of Luscar House built in 1838 by two of Scotland leading architects (David Bryce) of the time border the village. This house was in later years a residential care home. This category B listed building was largely destroyed by fire in 2001, following planning refusal to allow conversion into a hotel. In 2003 the house succumbed to demolition without planning consent. The stables being converted into modern living accommodation, legal proceedings followed resulting a controversially small fine (£300) being levied on the persons responsible. The village has two bus stops. Services run from Dunfermline bus station serving Carnock, Oakley, Fife and Saline, Fife. 

The Tulsa Tribune was an afternoon daily newspaper published in Tulsa, Oklahoma from 1919 to 1992. Owned and run by three generations of the Jones family, the "Tribune" closed in 1992 after the termination of its joint operating agreement with the morning "Tulsa World". In 1895, a group of Tulsans established a publication called "The New Era", intended to convey a more positive image of the then-small town than that found in the existing paper, "The Indian Republican". Supporters of Democratic Party leader William Jennings Bryan, they changed the name of "The New Era" to "The Democrat" in 1898. The paper was unprofitable and the publisher, R. L. Lunsford, sold it to Dave Jesse, who established the "Tulsa Democrat" as a daily in 1904, and sold it to William Stryker in 1905. Stryker sold the paper in 1916 (or 1915) to Charles Page, founder of the neighboring city of Sand Springs, who used the newspaper to promote his plan for the city of Tulsa to obtain its water from Shell Creek, near Sand Springs, rather than from Spavinaw in eastern Oklahoma. In November 1919, the "Tulsa Democrat" had 21,682 subscribers. In December 1919, Page sold the newspaper to Richard Lloyd Jones, who had previously owned the "Wisconsin State Journal" in Madison, Wisconsin. Jones changed the paper's name to "Tulsa Tribune-Democrat"; then, on January 19, 1920, he changed it again, to "Tulsa Tribune". As foreshadowed by this name change, the "Tribune" became a consistently Republican paper; it never endorsed a Democrat for U.S. president, and did not endorse a Democrat for governor until 1958. Richard Lloyd Jones (April 14, 1873 – December 4, 1963) was the son of an influential Unitarian minister, Jenkin Lloyd Jones. He co-founded Tulsa's All Souls Unitarian Church, now one of the largest Unitarian Universalist churches in the world. Jones commissioned his cousin, Frank Lloyd Wright, to build him a house in Tulsa; constructed in 1929, it is known as Westhope and listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The May 31, 1921 edition of the "Tribune" included an inflammatory front-page story entitled "Nab Negro for Attacking Girl in Elevator", about what was later found to be an accidental encounter between a white elevator operator and a black teenager, Dick Rowland. The "Tribune's" story is frequently named as a contributing factor in the Tulsa race massacre that broke out on June 1, 1921 and led to the destruction of the then-prosperous African-American Greenwood business district. It has been claimed that the same issue of the "Tribune" also contained a second article, or an editorial, reporting on plans by white residents to lynch Rowland. All originals of this edition of the newspaper were apparently destroyed, and the relevant pages are also missing from the microfilm copy, so the facts remain in dispute. The "Tribune" was also known for its opposition to Oklahoma Governor Jack C. Walton, who in 1923 declared martial law as part of his efforts to investigate the Ku Klux Klan. Walton later placed a censor at the "Tribune" offices after it ran an advertisement encouraging Klan members to resist his declaration. Walton was ultimately impeached and removed from office for his declaration of absolute martial law, which forgo habeas corpus, illegal in the Oklahoma constitution. William P. Steven, who would become a notable American news executive, joined the "Tulsa Tribune" in 1930 as a cub reporter. In 1937, he was named as managing editor of the paper. He continued to work in Tulsa until 1941, when he was appointed to the United States Office of Censorship. In 1941 the "Tribune" entered into a joint operating agreement with the morning "Tulsa World" and established the Newspaper Printing Corporation. The two papers co-existed, sharing their advertising, printing and circulation departments, until 1992. Richard Lloyd Jones passed on control of the newspaper to his sons, Richard Lloyd Jones Jr. (February 22, 1909 – January 27, 1982) and Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Sr. – February 24, 2004. In 1984 the "Tribune"s corporate owner merged with Swab-Fox Companies Inc., a diversified energy and real estate firm. Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Sr. was editor of the "Tribune" from 1941 to 1988, and publisher until 1991. A number of other Jones family members served in different business and editorial capacities on the paper, including Jenkin's son, Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Jr., who was the last publisher and editor of the paper. By 1992, the "Tribune's" circulation was about 67,000, as compared the 128,000 daily circulation (238,000 on Sunday) of its competitor, the morning "World". The papers had renegotiated their joint operating agreement in 1981, and it was due to expire in 1996. The "Tribune" had introduced a redesigned paper in October 1991 and was believed to be profitable, but negotiations for an extension of the joint operating agreement led instead to the "World's" July 31, 1992 announcement that it would not renew the agreement, and the "Tribune's" announcement that it would close down, part of a nationwide trend away from afternoon newspapers. The "World" paid the Tribune Company owner about $30 million for its share of the Newspaper Printing Corporation and other assets. The "Tribune" printed its last edition on September 30, 1992. In addition to his positions at the "Tribune", Jenkin Lloyd Jones, Sr., was a syndicated columnist whose column was carried in as many as 150 newspapers. He was president of the American Society of Newspaper Editors in 1956, and president of the United States Chamber of Commerce in 1969. Joseph A. Brandt was the city editor of the "Tribune" in the 1920s before moving into academia as head of the University of Oklahoma Press and Princeton University Press (and, briefly, as President of the University of Oklahoma). William P. Steven, who later held senior editor positions with the "Minneapolis Star" and "Tribune", "Houston Chronicle", and "Chicago Daily News" and "Sun-Times", began his career with the "Tulsa Tribune" in 1930 and served as managing editor from 1937 to 1941, before moving to the newly formed Office of Censorship. Other notable authors who worked at the "Tulsa Tribune" at some point in their careers included humorist H. Allen Smith, war correspondent Jim G. Lucas, science writer Martin Gardner, and sportswriter Mike Sowell. The Tribune Building, at 20 East Archer Street, was built in 1924 and housed the "Tribune" until 1942. It was the first building in Oklahoma built as a newspaper plant. It subsequently served as a storage facility and as a mission for the homeless. The building lay largely vacant from 1971 until 2001, when it was renovated and converted into loft apartments under the name Tribune Lofts. The building was listed in the National Register of Historic Places under Criteria A and C on July 16, 1979. Its NRIS number is 79003644. 

Mareeg (also known as Mareg, Meregh and Märēg) is a locality in central Somalia. The town was founded in the 13th century, during the period marked by the local ascendancy of the Ajuran Empire. It later came under the Hiraab Sultanate after the collapse of the Ajuran Empire in the late 17th century. At the turn of the 20th century, Warsheikh was incorporated into Italian Somaliland protectorate. After independence in 1960, the city was made the center of the official Mareeg District. According to the "catalogo" of the Museo della Garesa, coins from an early historical epoch were also recovered in the town. Ceeldheer.net 

Gerald Loeb (July 24, 1899 – April 13, 1974) was a founding partner of E.F. Hutton & Co., a renowned Wall Street trader and brokerage firm. He was the author of the books "The Battle For Investment Survival" and "The Battle For Stock Market Profits". Loeb promoted a view of the market as too risky to hold stocks for the long term in contrast to well known value investors. He also created the Gerald Loeb Award, given annually for excellence in various categories of financial journalism. He was married to the former Mrs. Rose Lobree Benjamin. Loeb began his career in 1921, working in the bond department of a securities firm in San Francisco. He moved to New York in 1924 after joining E. F. Hutton & Co., and became vice-chairman of the board when the company incorporated in 1962. Although he had largely avoided personal losses, the Wall Street Crash of 1929 greatly affected Loeb's investing style, making him skeptical of holding stocks for the long term. Loeb offered a contrarian investing viewpoint, in books and columns in "Barron's", "The Wall Street Journal", and "Investor Magazine". "Forbes" magazine called Loeb "the most quoted man on Wall Street." Loeb's first book, "The Battle for Investment Survival"(1935), sold over 200,000 copies during the Great Depression. Loeb updated the book in 1957 and 1965, as it attained the status of a classic financial text. In 1971, Loeb published "The Battle for Market Profits" as a follow up to his original book where he depicted the market as a battlefield. Loeb's books are still widely read today and hailed by many as a staple for investment professionals.

Nate Perry is an American rock bass player and songwriter. He grew up in Northern California and has been based in Los Angeles since 1999 where he has performed, toured and recorded with several artists including CSS, Manic, Middle Class Rut, Jesse Spencer of the Fox show "House", Fractional Importance, Stars Align, Art of Chaos, and Toadies guitarist Darrel Herbert. Nate is now employed by Live Nation Entertainment and is a production manager at The Wiltern in Los Angeles, CA. Nate Perry began his professional music career at 19 as a production bassist on cruise ships while pursuing a B.A. in music from Humboldt State University & The University of Memphis, where he appeared with The Memphis Symphony. Shortly after relocating to Los Angeles, he joined Fractional Importance who released three records independently; including "Visions", recorded by Don Kazarinoff (Incubus). Fractional gained regional popularity, opening for such bands as System of a Down, Alien Ant Farm, Smile Empty Soul and Seether, before eventually breaking up in 2004. In 2006, Perry briefly played in pop/rock band Stars Align(formerly Neve). Following a performance at The Troubadour, the band caught the interest of guitarist Joe Don Rooney of Rascal Flatts fame who went on to work with the group. They released a self-titled EP in 2009, produced by Rooney, which featured Perry on bass guitar. Dissatisfied with the band's Hot AC musical aspirations, Perry left Stars Align in 2007 to join experimental rock group Manic. The band released their debut EP, "Floorboards" on Geffen Records, which led to appearances at SXSW '07 as well as regional touring, including a residency at famed L.A. venue The Echo. Their second EP, "Another New Home", featured writing by Perry; including the track "Carolina Ghost" which received airplay on the now defunct Indie 103.1. The song was later remixed by Joel Petersen of The Faint and released as a limited edition 7" vinyl on Suretone Records. Although the band's efforts received favorable press, drawing comparisons to Pink Floyd & Radiohead, they fell short of major label sales expectations and disbanded in late 2008. Nate performed with various L.A. based artists from 2008-2010 including former Toadies guitarist Darrel Herbert and Dwight Yoakam drummer, Mitch Marine. The trio recorded under the moniker DWH and later, No Tomorrow, self-releasing an EP in 2010. Perry also played locally with actor Jesse Spencer, known for his role on the hit show House, M.D., alongside singer Julian Sakata under the name The Ruby Fakes. In 2011 he received an M.M. from Cal State L.A. in Commercial Music where he taught as a graduate assistant. In the fall of 2011, Perry was recruited by Brazilian Sub Pop band CSS to be their touring bassist, following the departure of original member Adriano Cintra. Nate performed extensively with the band on tours of North America, Australia and Japan in support of their third studio album, "La Liberación". During this period, the band appeared at the 2011 Falls Festival in Australia alongside Fleet Foxes and Group Love, as well as at the Corona Capital Festival in Mexico City, with The Strokes and Moby. The group was especially well received in Japan, selling out famed Tokyo venue Studio Coast. Perry continued to tour with CSS throughout 2012, doing small tours and one-off performances throughout California and the Southwest. In 2012, Perry performed and recorded several bass tracks on the sophomore Middle Class Rut LP, "Pick Up Your Head", released June 2013 on Bright Antenna Records.

Symphyotrichum depauperatum, also known as the serpentine aster, is a rare species of aster adapted to serpentine barrens, an ecosystem with a high concentration of toxic metals in the soil. "Symphyotrichum depauperatum" is a perennial herb up to 50 cm (20 inches) tall, with 1-3 stems. Leaves are narrow, generally 2–4 cm (0.8-1.6 inches) long. The plant produces numerous flower heads in branched arrays, each head with 7–14 white or pink ray flowers surrounding 7–17 yellow disc flowers. "Symphyotrichum depauperatum" grows in 20 of the 26 serpentine barrens in the east-central United States (Pennsylvania, Maryland, Virginia, North Carolina), and has been called a "flagship" species of this unique ecosystem. It was previously thought to be endemic to these barrens, but it was recently confirmed to also occur in a disjoint population on diabase glades in North Carolina. "Symphyotrichum depauperatum" is classified by the state of Pennsylvania as a threatened species because its range is restricted to a few limited areas, and the majority of its populations occur on sites threatened by quarrying, housing and industrial development. 

The Orpheum Theatre is a live performance and musical theater in downtown Madison, Wisconsin, located one block from the Wisconsin State Capitol. Built in 1926 by Rapp and Rapp, the Limestone, Art Deco exterior and French Renaissance interior made the building an icon, with the "Orpheum" sign towering over State Street. There have been limited changes to the structure of the building over the years. The terrazzo floors, chandeliers, grand staircase, and statue of Orpheus overlooking the entryway are still intact. Partially financed by dentist William Beecroft, also known as "Mr. Theater," The Orpheum cost $750,000 to build and originally featured vaudeville shows and a movie theater, later featuring contemporary artists and film. The Orpheum sponsors the yearly Madison Independent Film Festival and serves food daily from its Lobby Lounge restaurant. The Orpheum Theatre in Madison is on The National Register of Historic Places listings in Wisconsin 

Patrick Osmund Lewry (1929–1987) was an English Dominican who made significant contributions to the history of logic and the philosophy of language in the thirteenth century. Lewry studied mathematical logic under Lejewski and A.N. Prior at Manchester (1961–2). From 1962–7 he taught the philosophy of language and logic at Hawkesyard. He was assigned to the Oxford Blackfriars in 1967. Dissatisfaction with teaching led him to work for an Oxford D.Phil. on the logic teaching of Robert Kilwardby. In 1979 he began the study of the history of grammar, logic and rhetoric at Oxford in the period 1220–1320. In 1979 he went to the Pontifical Institute of Mediaeval Studies in Toronto first as a research associate, then as a senior fellow. He died on 23 April 1987 at the age of 57 at the Oxford Dominican House. Lewry wrote multiple works on Kilwardby's works, and argued that Kilwardby influenced Roger Bacon's thoughts. In particular, Kilwardby is argued to have influenced Bacon's theories on epistemology. Also, Lewry specialized in identifying medieval sources and the attribution of authors for various manuscripts with a special focus on the works attributed to Kilwardby. In one instance, he provided evidence that the work "Commenti super Priscianum Maiorem", previously attributed to Kilwardby, was not, in fact, written by the medieval thinker. Later critics have followed his lead and removed any attribution. Lewry was not limited to the works of Kilwardby; he also provided evidence regarding works attributed to Pseudo-Scotus.

Estúdios Globo (Globo Studios, in English), formerly known as Projac, is the main center of television production of the Grupo Globo and Latin Americas largest audio-visual production center. Opened in 1995, it is located in the city of Rio de Janeiro, Brazil. Often is called of CGP-Central Globo de Produção (Globo Production Center). The CGP-Central Globo de Produção (Globo Production Center), located in Curicica, Jacarepaguá, is the largest production center in the world, with an area of 1 million and 600 thousand m2, housing studios, fictional cities, islands of editing, post production, special effects, factory settings, costumes, technical support to production, administration and services. Currently, Projac holds twelve recording studios, three snack bars, a restaurant, bank. They are often building new studios, centers support to fictional cities, a theater and an administrative building. In 2016, Projac rename as Estúdios Globo (Globo Studios). The former Rede Globo studios, opened in 1965, were too small for the station's productions. In 1975, the Teatro Fênix was inaugurated, for the production of auditorium programs. In 1980, it was found that the station's facilities would become improper in a short time. Projac (then called Jacarepaguá Project) was designed to house the studios, administration, production, direction; and leave the Botanical Garden. The greatness of Projac, between conception and inauguration, constitutes an undertaking that took almost fifteen years to be completed. In the long interval between the departure of Globo from its former studios and the definitive entry into Projac, the broadcaster rented other spaces, such as Atlântida Cinematográfica, Cyll Farney's Tycoon studios, part of Renato Aragão's studios, TV Tupi's studios at the old Cassino da Urca, Pólo Rio de Cinema e Vídeo and the Herbert Richers studios, besides producing some programs at the Teatro Fênix. On August 8, 2019, the Production Module 4 (MG4) was inaugurated, incorporating three new studios (K, L, M), with a built area of 26,000 m². The complex now occupies a total area of 1.73 million m², with thirteen production studios, expanding the production capacity of soap operas, series, miniseries, realities, original formats, humor shows and varieties.

Gerald S. Lestz (March 29, 1914 – September 15, 2009) was an American newspaper columnist, author, activist, philanthropist and publisher. Lestz is credited with leading the efforts to found the Demuth Museum at the childhood home of artist Charles Demuth on East King Street in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Lestz, the first child of immigrant parents, Jacob and Fannie Simon Lestz, was born on March 29, 1914, at their home at 511 South Shippen Street in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. Lestz graduated from the now defunct Lancaster Boys High School in 1931. He earned his bachelor's degree in merchandising from the Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania in 1935. His first job after college was at the upstart "Lancaster Independent" weekly newspaper. Lestz was hired to write the names of subscribers in circulation books for a starting salary of $15 per week. The now-defunct newspaper's editor, Willim N. Yonung, later promoted Lestz to a reporter. Gerry Lestz enlisted in the United States Army Air Force during World War II. He met his first wife, Edith Allport Lestz, during the war years. The couple moved to Lancaster following World War II and had two children. Edith Allport Lestz died in 1957. Lestz later married his second wife, Margaret Gordon Dana, an artist, who died in 2006. Lestz returned to his native Lancaster after World War II, where he began writing for the "Lancaster New Era" newspaper. Lestz would remain on staff at the "Lancaster New Era" for more than thirty years, focusing on feature articles, columns and editorials. On December 17, 1957, began writing "The Scribbler" column, a regular piece on Lancaster's history which had appeared in the" Lancaster New Era" since 1919 (with the exception of a period during World War II). Lestz continued to write "The Scribbler" twice a week, every week, until his retirement from the newspaper in 1979. Following Lestz's retirement, "The Scribbler" was taken over by Jack Brubaker, who continues to write the now weekly column as of 2011. Lestz also headed efforts to establish several cultural and civic institutions in Lancaster. For example, Lestz co-founded the Historic Preservation Trust of Lancaster County. Most notably, Lestz led the campaign to establish the Demuth Museum at the restored childhood home of Charles Demuth, Lancaster's most famous native artist. The museum was known as the Charles Demuth Foundation at the time of its establishment in 1981. Lestz served as the Demuth Foundation's president for museum's first three years. Under Lestz, the Demuth Foundation acquired the Charles Demuth home on East King Street, which became the museum. Lestz and the Foundation also purchased the property next door to the future Demuth Museum from Dorothea and Christopher Demuth. That second property houses the oldest continually operating tobacco shop in the United States. Both structures were converted into a museum by the Foundation which houses works by Charles Demuth as well as the tobacco shop. Carol Morgan, who became the director of the Charles Demuth Foundation in 1985, noted Lestz's contributions the museum and foundation after examining Lestz records, ""I was absolutely stunned at the amount of personal work, planning and bureaucratic threading he went through to get that thing launched."" Lestz also helped to found the Heritage Center of Lancaster County, and served as the organizations president. He also served as the president of the Lancaster Summer Arts Festival, the Lancaster Public Library, Lancaster Community Concert Association, as well as the state president for the Pennsylvania Guild of Craftsmen. Lestz also published dozens of books and pamphlets on a variety of topics related to history, architecture, the Amish community, folklore and art. He published and edited the Baer's Almanac from 1948 until 2008. The Baer's Almanac is a Lancaster County publication founded in 1825. From 1986 to 2002, he was publisher of The Strasburg Weekly News, a small newspaper founded in 1898, and continued to contribute a weekly column to the paper until his death. Gerry Lestz died at his home on Conestoga Drive in Lancaster Township, Pennsylvania, on September 15, 2009, at the age of 95. He was survived by his son, Michael Elliot Lestz, daughter, Linda Lestz Weidman; stepson, Robert Gordon Dana; eight grandchildren and eight great-grandchildren.

Popelogan Depot is an unincorporated community in Restigouche County, New Brunswick, Canada. The etymology of the word Popelogan has been debated greatly over the years. One theory is that the word derives from the Maliseet simply describing "a place to stop at, where one touches." According to the linguist Rand, the word was of Mi'kmaq origin and meant "long narrow stone." According to a traveler in the area in the late nineteenth century, a Mi'kmaq chief said that the area meant "a bad place to get logs out." Most likely the word is a bastardization of "pokeloken" a word used by lumberjacks from Maine, who worked in New Brunswick, which means "marsh." <br> <br>

BioSense is a program of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) that tracks health problems as they evolve and provides public health officials with the data, information and tools they need to better prepare for and coordinate responses to safeguard and improve the health of the American people. By integrating local and state-level information, CDC will provide a timely and cohesive picture at the regional (i.e., multistate) and national levels and improve BioSense's utility. The key components of the BioSense program redesign are to: Mandated in the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Preparedness Response Act of 2002, the CDC BioSense Program was launched in 2003 to establish an integrated national public health surveillance system for early detection and rapid assessment of potential bioterrorism-related illness. By November 2011, the Redesigned BioSense (or BioSense 2.0) will develop a community-controlled environment (architecturally distributed in a cloud-based model) governed by the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO), in coordination with the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE), National Association of County and City Health Officials (NACCHO), and International Society for Disease Surveillance (ISDS). ASTHO will offer this service to states for receiving and managing syndromic surveillance information. The cloud-based BioSense 2.0 environment allows State and Local health departments to access data that will support potential expansions of their syndromic surveillance systems under the Meaningful Use program. States that elect to use this utility will each have a secure "zone" that they control and can use to manage or share their syndromic surveillance information.

The 2009–10 season was French football club Paris Saint-Germain's 37th professional season, their 37th season in Ligue 1 and their 36th consecutive season in French top-flight. PSG was managed by Antoine Kombouaré. The club was chaired by Robin Leproux. Paris Saint-Germain was present in the Ligue 1, the Coupe de France and the Coupe de la Ligue. Paris Saint-Germain's average home gate was 33,266, the fourth highest in Ligue 1. A few weeks before the end of his short term as president of Paris Saint-Germain, Sébastien Bazin, chair of the club's supervisory board and head of Colony Capital in Europe, assigned a clear goal for the capital club, especially to Robin Leproux, the future president of the club, and Antoine Kombouaré, the new manager. Bazin stated his expectations from the upcoming managerial tenure of former PSG player Antoine Kombouaré, as well as revealing his reasons for not making Alain Roche director of football. He also considered that Colony Capital, PSG's majority shareholder, was not behind in its development plan of the club, three years after its partial takeover. The U.S. investment firm had envisioned a six-year development plan to transform Paris Saint-Germain into an economically profitable and successful football club. Bazin declared that PSG started the season with the prospect of regaining European status: Paris Saint-Germain and Valenciennes reached a final agreement which allowed Antoine Kombouaré to join as first team coach for the next three seasons with an option for a fourth. Zoumana Camara signed a new one-year contract extension until 2012. Loris Arnaud signed a new two-year contract extension until 2012. Nicolas Dehon replaced Christian Mas as goalkeeping coach. Yves Bertucci committed to Paris Saint-Germain for one year as Antoine Kombouaré's assistant coach. Guillaume Hoarau signed an extension to his current contract until 2013. Colony Capital acquired all the shares of Morgan Stanley and became 95% owners of Paris Saint-Germain. Claude Makélélé signed a new one-year contract extension until 2010. Stéphane Sessègnon signed a one-year contract until 2013. Ceará penned a new deal until 2012. Sylvain Armand signed a new deal until 2012. PSG president Sébastien Bazin announced that Robin Leproux joined the club's board of directors. Péguy Luyindula signed a new two-year contract extension until 2012. Robin Leproux replaced Sébastien Bazin and became the new president of Paris Saint-Germain. Granddi Ngoyi penned a new three-year deal until 2013. Paris mayor Bertrand Delanoë announced that the Parc des Princes would be renovated to host the UEFA Euro 2016. The club launched the Passion PSG membership, a relationship program unique in French football to strengthen the sense of community among their supporters. Younousse Sankharé signed a two-year extension until 2012. Paris Saint-Germain's eagerly-anticipated encounter with Olympique de Marseille was postponed after two club players had contracted swine flu. Ludovic Giuly and Mamadou Sakho were the first to be infected, before Jérémy Clément picked up the H1N1 virus. Robin Leproux announced his intentions of reviving the Tournoi de Paris for the 2010–11 season on the occasion of the club's 40th Anniversary. Claude Makélélé announced his retirement from professional football at the end of the season. Yann L., a Paris Saint-Germain fan injured in a fight between rival factions of hooligans from the club, was left in a life-threatening coma ahead of the league match between fierce rivals PSG and Marseille. The clashes involved hooligans from the two main stands at the Parc des Princes, the Tribune d'Auteuil and the Kop of Boulogne. Boulogne Boys member Yann L. was attacked by another PSG group, the Supras Auteuil. OM fans had boycotted the match to protest against security measures imposed on visiting supporters. After several months of relative tranquility, Boulogne and Auteuil fans, angered by their team's poor results and a mutual opposition to the club's chief backer, Colony Capital, started fighting again at the end of last year and clashed violently at Lille in January. Robin Leproux reported the club would not make available tickets to their fans for away games until further notice. Yann L. died in the hospital after being in a coma since 28 February. The LFP announced that PSG would play their next three fixtures behind closed doors. Laurent Perpère and Francis Graille, two former presidents of Paris Saint-Germain, were handed suspended jail sentences and fines over a series of suspect transfers between 1998 and 2003. Perpère was given an 18-month suspended sentence and a 40,000-euros fine, while Graille received a one-year suspended sentence and a €20,000 fine. They set up the illegal scheme which included players, agents and Nike France. Nike France and PSG were respectively fined €120,000 and €150,000 for their part in the operation. French Prime Minister François Fillon and Interior Minister Brice Hortefeux disbanded five PSG ultras supporters groups in light of the violence at the Parc des Princes. From the Tribune d'Auteuil, the groups Supras Auteuil 1991, Paris 1970 la Grinta and Les Authentiks were dissolved. At the other end of the pitch, the Kop of Boulogne lost Commando Loubard and Milice Paris. Once again, however, it was unclear how this would result in anything different regarding violence in the stands. Technically, the Boulogne Boys were banned in 2008, but most of their members have simply infiltrated other groups in the Kop of Boulogne. The Tournoi de Paris was officially confirmed for 2010. Tribune de Auteuil supporters called for a "peaceful march" in protest against the new anti-violence plan which was being set up by the club management. The majority shareholder of PSG and the supervisory board of the club extended the tenure of president Robin Leproux until 2013. The LFP announced the classification of training centers for the 2009–10 season. Paris Saint-Germain was ranked 11th, but at the forefront of the list regarding the selection of club-grown players. Total spending: €16.2 million Total income: €5.48 million Nike manufactured the kits for Paris Saint-Germain and Emirates Airlines continued to be the club's main sponsor. Nike have been PSG's official kit provider since 1989. Emirates have been the club's partner since 2005 and the major shirt sponsor since January 2006. PSG were handed brand new home and away kits. The home shirt was mainly PSG's traditional home colours of Navy Blue. Red pinstripes ran down the shirt and sleeves. The collar and ends of the sleeves were red, dropping the club's 'historical' shirt and causing some controversy amongst the fans, as it strayed away from the more traditional blue shirt with a central red vertical stripe trimmed with white. The away shirt was mostly white. The shirt featured a blue and red polkadott pattern around the whole shirt. There was a red piping around the ends of the sleeves and collars. The shirts had the club badge on the top-left, the Nike logo on the top-right and the club sponsor Fly Emirates written across the middle. Just like last season, Paris Saint-Germain opened their pre-season campaign with a victory over Pontivy. Christophe Jallet and Grégory Coupet both made their debuts in the famous red and blue colours. PSG encountered few problems against Nantes, relegated from the French top-flight last season, with defender Sammy Traoré nodding "Les Parisiens" in front from a Clément Chantôme free-kick before Serbian striker Mateja Kežman made sure of victory shortly before half-time. Just two weeks before the start of the Ligue 1 season, PSG continued their pre-season preparation with a draw against a physical Greek side from Panthrakikos. Invited by Italian outfit Fiorentina, PSG attended the and stole the show scoring three unanswered goals, including Mevlüt Erdinç's first goal for new club Paris Saint-Germain, confirming that Antoine Kombouaré's squad was in tip top form just ten days from the start of the campaign. Paris attended Arsenal's Emirates Cup for the second time and suffered their first of the pre-season at the hands of Rangers in their opening match. New striker Mevlüt Erdinç, a 10 million signing from Sochaux, spurned a host of first-half chances for "Les Parisiens", who found themselves on the back foot for much of the first period. Paris Saint-Germain showed great character in coming back to equalize while playing a man down against Atlético Madrid in the second day of the tournament. The pre-season lived up to all its promise and was certainly a positive outing for Antoine Kombouaré's side. Paris Saint-Germain prepared for the trip to Marseille in style with a win over Portuguese leaders Sporting Braga. The match was notable for Zoumana Camara gracing the Parc des Princes for the first time in the season after recovering from phlebitis. Clément Chantôme scored the opening two PSG goals and laid on an assist for Yannick Boli to add a late third. PSG was involved in a friendly match ahead of French Cup action, the men from the capital doing their coach proud with four unanswered goals against Ligue 2 side Vannes. Ludovic Giuly broke the deadlock and Vannes's Patrick Leugueun scored an own goal before Jean-Eudes Maurice added a third. Mevlüt Erdinç rounded out the scoring. Paris Saint-Germain announced their participation in the Chicago Sister Cities International Cup. After a season in which they disappointed in Ligue 1 but won the French Cup for the eighth time, Antoine Kombouaré's side flew to New York City for a short visit before heading to Chicago for the tournament against Legia Warsaw, Red Star Belgrade and hosts Chicago Fire. A narrow win against Chicago Fire took them through to a final meeting with Serbian league runners-up Red Star Belgrade. Paris Saint-Germain brought the curtain down on their end-of-season US tour with a defeat on penalties against Red Star Belgrade in the final of the Sister Cities Cup. An injury-time goal from Emir Spahić earned 10-man new boys Montpellier a dramatic draw at home to Paris Saint-Germain on the opening day of the season. Antoine Kombouaré's men notched their first win against Le Mans thanks to goals from Mevlüt Erdinç and Ludovic Giuly. Paris Saint-Germain coach Antoine Kombouaré made a winning return to former club Valenciennes as his side took all three points. Paris Saint-Germain kept themselves up with Ligue 1's leading pack with a home win over struggling Lille. In a frenetic final ten minutes that saw two goals and the expulsion of PSG's Stéphane Sessègnon, AS Monaco secured a dramatic win over the capital club at the Stade Louis II. Substitute Bafétimbi Gomis swooped to grab an equalizer five minutes from time as Olympique Lyonnais maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a draw at Paris Saint-Germain. Guillaume Hoarau found the net for the first time this season as Paris Saint-Germain picked up a point with a draw at Lorient. Paris Saint-Germain's bright start to the season is now a fading memory as Antoine Kombouaré's men stuttered to a third successive league draw as they were held by Nancy. Albin Ebondo's strike was enough for hosts Toulouse to edge out Paris Saint-Germain. Mevlüt Erdinç returned to former club Sochaux and scored PSG's third but also missed a first-half penalty as the capital club won for the first time since Week 4. A late goal on the counter-attack from Loïc Rémy allowed Nice to snatch three points from their trip to face Paris Saint-Germain. Gabriel Heinze's header was enough for Olympique de Marseille to take the honours in the rescheduled Clasico, dominating a struggling Paris Saint-Germain to climb to fourth place. Auxerre's winning run was ended at seven after Jérémy Clément gave Paris Saint-Germain all three points at the Parc des Princes. Paris Saint-Germain scored four times in the space of nine minutes after the break on their way to a win over struggling Boulogne. Bordeaux stretched their lead at the top of Ligue 1 to four points with a victory over Paris Saint-Germain after Jaroslav Plašil headed home Benoît Trémoulinas's cross. A scintillating first-half display from Paris Saint-Germain gave them a win over Saint-Étienne to compound "Les Verts'" current problems. Lens came away from the French capital with a valuable point after holding Paris Saint-Germain to a draw with both goals coming in a frenetic four-minute spell in the second-half. Ismaël Bangoura's strike was enough for Rennes to convert their domination over Paris into three points and climb to provisional fourth place on the Ligue 1 table. A strong Paris Saint-Germain side piled more misery on Grenoble at the Parc des Princes, but the scoreline was harsh on a visiting side that were on top for long spells and hit the woodwork twice. Lille romped to a seventh successive Ligue 1 victory in their win over Paris Saint-Germain. An own goal from 'keeper Apoula Edel handed a precious three points to Monaco when the two sides fought out a frenetic league encounter at the Parc des Princes. Mevlüt Erdinç fired Paris Saint-Germain in front but Mamadou Sakho's red card changed everything and Bafétimbi Gomis and Cris struck Lyon's second half goals. Lorient improved their already impressive record in the capital as they outclassed struggling Paris Saint-Germain to condemn their hosts to a fourth successive league defeat. Antoine Kombouaré's men managed to avoid a fifth consecutive league loss as they drew in Nancy in a cagey match that saw both sides taking no risks in the search of a winner. Guillaume Hoarau scored for the first time since September as Paris Saint-Germain recorded a morale-boosting win over ten-man Toulouse at the Parc des Princes. Marseille enjoyed their biggest ever win at the Parc des Princes over Paris Saint-Germain. Stéphane Sessègnon popped up four minutes into injury time to snatch a draw for troubled Paris Saint-Germain at Lens, after Sébastien Roudet's strike was set to hand the hosts all three points. Mevlüt Erdinç gave the striking Paris fans something to sing about as his hat-trick against former club Sochaux led PSG to a comprehensive win at the Parc des Princes. Loïc Rémy's late strike proved enough for Nice to beat Paris Saint-Germain behind closed doors at the Stade du Ray. Paris Saint-Germain were playing their third match in a week behind closed doors, but they made light work of ten-man Boulogne at the Parc des Princes. Auxerre missed out on the opportunity to ease clear of their title rivals at the top of the Ligue 1 table as they were held by a battling Paris Saint-Germain side. Bordeaux suffered a second major setback in a week, beaten at Paris Saint-Germain after veteran back-up goalkeeper Ulrich Ramé was sent off. Defence was the order of the day as a new-look PSG line-up managed a scoreless draw with a 17th-placed Saint-Étienne side. Paris Saint-Germain had to settle for a point at the Parc des Princes after the woodwork came to Rennes' rescue three times in the latter stages. Grenoble thumped Cup finalists Paris Saint-Germain at the Stade des Alpes with two goals in each half. Mateja Kežman's late strike looked to have secured all three points for PSG against Valenciennes, but Fahid Ben Khalfallah's reply a minute later rescued the draw. Ligue 2-bound Le Mans recorded their first-ever home victory over Paris Saint-Germain in the top-flight thanks to an early own-goal from Sylvain Armand. Montpellier booked a Europa League spot with a win at the Parc des Princes, while PSG finished 13th. Paris Saint-Germain entered the French Cup at the round of 64, as all Ligue 1 clubs did. Paris was pitted against fifth tier club Aubervilliers.

The League Cup draw for the third round was held and threw up no less than six all-Ligue 1 ties, including Paris Saint-Germain's trip to Boulogne. Jean-Eudes Maurice scored the goal that separated the two Ligue 1 sides on the hour. Boulogne had several chances but could not beat veteran goalkeeper Grégory Coupet. Midfielder Clément Chantôme hit the post for PSG late on. PSG travelled to French Cup holders Guingamp for the last-16. PSG quit the League Cup after they lost their last-16 clash away to Guingamp.

"Tardy for the Party" is a song by American television personality Kim Zolciak; it was independently released on September 1, 2009. The track was written and produced by her "The Real Housewives of Atlanta" castmate Kandi Burruss, with additional lyrical contributions from Zolciak, Brandon Joel Bowles, and Darnell Richard. "Tardy for the Party" was written by Kandi Burruss, Zolciak, Brandon Joel Bowles, and Darnell Richard, and was produced solely by Burruss. Zolciak claimed that her daughter Brielle drafted the original lyrics when she was 9 years old, which were later reworked by Burruss during formal recording sessions. The production of "Tardy for the Party" was documented on the second season of the reality television series "The Real Housewives of Atlanta", in which Zolciak and Burruss are featured. After Zolciak requested that the track be a duet with fellow housewife NeNe Leakes, Burruss began making arrangements for the women to record together. However, the song ultimately became a solo performance by Zolciak, placing a strain on Leakes' friendships with her and Burruss. In October 2009, Nielsen Soundscan reported that "Tardy for the Party" had sold approximately 29,000 digital downloads, while Mediabase revealed that the track had been played six times on radio stations. In September 2011, "The Hollywood Reporter" noted that the song had moved 101,000 copies since its premiere, with illegal downloads increasing ownership of the track to over one million individuals. Zolciak first performed "Tardy for the Party" during the reunion for the second season of "The Real Housewives of Atlanta", broadcast by Bravo on November 5, 2009. Dressed in black leggings and leather boots, Zolciak was accompanied by two female backup dancers, and encouraged her fellow housewives Leakes, Sheree Whitfield, and Lisa Wu-Hartwell to "c'mon bitches" in the midst of the performance. During the bridge of the song through the end of the recording, Zolciak was joined onstage by Burruss. Donald Deane from "The Huffington Post" characterized the segment as an "assault to the senses", while Brian Moylan from Gawker Media labeled it "the scariest thing to happen on television" since Britney Spears' performance of "Gimme More" at the 2007 MTV Video Music Awards. Zolciak later sang "Tardy for the Party" on February 26, 2010, at the Gold Room in Atlanta and during an April 9, 2010 appearance on"The Wendy Williams Show". Since 2010, Burruss has claimed that Zolciak withheld payment for her services during production of "Tardy for the Party". The ensuing conflict between the women became a central plotline during the third and fourth seasons of "The Real Housewives of Atlanta", which appeared to have been resolved during a season 4 reunion episode. However, Burruss filed a lawsuit against Zolciak on March 14, 2013, coincidentally the same day that the fifth season reunion was filmed. Burruss was represented by fellow housewife Phaedra Parks, and alleged that Zolciak made profit from the track "without [the] plaintiffs' authorization, license or consent." The lawsuit was dismissed on October 12, 2013, after the presiding judge deemed that Burruss failed to furnish enough evidence of copyright infringement. 

Hayden Bridge, a Howe truss structure, spans the Alsea River about west of Alsea, Oregon, United States. Constructed in 1918, the span is one of only seven remaining covered bridges in Oregon that were built before 1920. Similar spans such as the Mill Creek Bridge crossed the Alsea or one of its tributaries in the same vicinity, but only the Hayden Bridge has survived. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979. Located along Hayden Road just south of Oregon Route 34, the bridge was either partly or completely rebuilt in 1945. Changes included larger and less rounded bridge portals that could accommodate larger vehicles. Narrow openings under the side-wall eaves on both sides of the span illuminated the interior. The bridge, repaired again in 2003, required further work in 2006 after a logging truck crashed into it. Of the more than 600 covered bridges once found in Oregon, only 50 remain. After 1915, although some were of queen-post or king-post design, most of the new covered bridges were of Howe-truss design. In that year, the Oregon legislature passed a law giving the Oregon State Highway Department oversight powers for bridges worth more than $500. The department developed plans for Howe-truss bridges, partly because they were relatively easy to assemble, and distributed them to the state's counties. Many of these bridges, often built with Douglas-fir timber available locally, were replaced in the 1940s and 1950s by bridges more suited to logging trucks and other big vehicles. Although most of the original bridges no longer exist, the remaining bridges have gained value as tourist attractions.

Cogs, Wheels & Lovers is the twenty-first studio album by British folk rock band Steeleye Span. It was released on 26 October 2009. It is the band's fourth studio album to feature the line-up of Maddy Prior, Peter Knight, Rick Kemp, Ken Nicol and Liam Genockey. The songs on the album are entirely traditional pieces. As such, this album marks a return to the band's early pattern of recording modern arrangements of traditional songs, and marks a departure of its tendency, demonstrated since the early 1980s, of doing both traditional songs and songs they wrote themselves. "Cogs, Wheels and Lovers" was the last album to feature guitarist Ken Nicol.

The Coconut War was a brief clash between Papua New Guinean soldiers and rebels in Espiritu Santo shortly before and after the independence of the Republic of Vanuatu was declared on 30 July 1980. Prior to Vanuatu's independence, the islands were known as the New Hebrides. The New Hebrides were governed by a condominium of France and the United Kingdom. In 1980, France and the United Kingdom agreed that Vanuatu would be granted independence on 30 July 1980. Beginning in June 1980, Jimmy Stevens, head of the Nagriamel movement, led an uprising against the colonial officials and the plans for independence. The uprising lasted about 12 weeks. The rebels blockaded Santo-Pekoa International Airport, destroyed two bridges, and declared the independence of Espiritu Santo island as the "State of Vemerana". Stevens was supported by French-speaking landowners and by the Phoenix Foundation, an American business foundation that supported the establishment of a libertarian tax haven in the New Hebrides. On 8 June 1980, the New Hebrides government asked Britain and France to send troops to put down a rebellion on the island of Espiritu Santo. France and Britain sent troops but the French refused to allow them to take any effective action against the rebels. As independence day neared, the Prime Minister-elect, Walter Lini, asked Papua New Guinea if it would send troops to intervene. As Papua New Guinean soldiers began arriving in Espiritu Santo, the foreign press began referring to the ongoing events as the "Coconut War". However, the "war" was brief and unconventional. The residents of Espiritu Santo generally welcomed the Papua New Guineans as fellow Melanesians. Stevens's followers were armed with only bows and arrows, rocks, and slings. There were few casualties, and the war came to a sudden end: when a vehicle carrying Stevens's son burst through a Papua New Guinean roadblock in late August 1980, the soldiers opened fire on the vehicle, killing Stevens's son. Shortly thereafter, Jimmy Stevens surrendered, stating that he had never intended that anyone be harmed. At Stevens's trial, the support of the Phoenix Foundation to the Nagriamel movement was revealed. It was also revealed that the French government had secretly supported Stevens in his efforts. Stevens was sentenced to 14 years' imprisonment; he remained in prison until 1991. 

A caucus revolt occurs when enough members of a political party pressure its leadership to step down or to remove planned bills, legislation or policies from its platform. A caucus revolt generally concludes with the party leader resigning their position as such a revolt is usually seen to show poor leadership skills. Often the mere appearance of a revolt in the caucus maybe enough to force a leader to step down. In Westminster style governments, if the party suffering from a caucus revolt is the current government, often an interim leader will be appointed by the party until a leadership convention can be held to elect a new leader, or a general election can be called should the party leader find a way to survive the revolt. The 1937 Social Credit backbenchers' revolt against the premiership of William Aberhart in Alberta ultimately forced the premier to hand over considerable power to a committee of backbenchers, the Social Credit Board. The Board brought in British social credit "experts" who proposed radical legislation which led to a constitutional crisis when it was repeatedly blocked: first disallowed by the federal government, then reserved by Lieutenant-Governor John C. Bowen, and ultimately struck down by the Supreme Court of Canada. After successfully leading the Liberal Party of Canada and being Prime Minister of Canada for over ten years, Jean Chrétien was forced to step down as both Party Leader and Prime Minister of Canada at the threat of a Caucus Revolt from his longtime Minister of Finance and political rival, Paul Martin Jr. 

Bert and Ernie's Great Adventures (originally promoted as "The Adventures of Bert and Ernie") is an animated series developed by Sesame Workshop in which CGI-animated versions of Bert and Ernie use their imaginations to travel to strange places and into entertaining situations. The shorts are shown in the United States as inserts on "Sesame Street" (first appearing in season 39). Internationally, the shorts are shown as a stand-alone series in various overseas markets (the first season debuting in September 2007).

The "Secret Agents" episode has received the Gold Award for the Children's Animation category at the 2009 World Media Festival, as well as being a selection at the 2009 Annecy Animation Festival. Each episode begins with Bert and Ernie climbing into their beds for a good night's sleep. Suddenly, Bert's bed starts shaking and tapping, and Ernie hops aboard as the bed flies out of their apartment and into their next great adventure. Each adventure has Bert and Ernie in a new location and a new situation. Sometimes they're accompanied by Bert's trusted pigeon-friend Bernice, or Ernie's toy Rubber Duckie. Often they encounter new and old friends, and also adversaries, along the way. In the United States, six episodes were released on "Sesame Street: Count on Sports" ("Tiny Town", "Inventors", "Mountain Climbers" and "Cavemen"), "Pirates: Elmo and the Bookaneers" ("Pirates") and "Sesame Street: 40 Years of Sunny Days" ("Penguin").

When Hitler annexed Austria in 1938, she fled to the Netherlands with her boyfriend Hans Stein. She married Hans Stein after they moved to the Netherlands in 1938. Instead of leaving the Netherlands after the German invasion, Flagg took the identity of the deceased Lydia Voskuilen. When she became pregnant with her son Michael, she hid the child in a sanitarium and posed as a nurse in order to visit him. Hans Stein was captured by Germans and sent to Auschwitz where he died in 1944. After Stein's death, Flagg worked within the Dutch underground resistance where she met her second husband Erich Simon Flegenheimer (later known as Eric Flagg), and after the war they married. Together they were responsible for saving several lives. She acted as a spy, swimming with Nazi soldiers and relaying what she overheard. Flagg reportedly killed two Nazis. Eric then moved to the United States and Edith and Michael lived on a kibbutz in Palestine, what would soon become Israel. Edith and Michael followed Eric to the United States and while Eric worked in New York, Edith and Michael moved to San Francisco and lived with Hans' parents. Edith, Eric and Michael then moved to Los Angeles in 1949. Flagg started her career after arriving in New York in 1948 as a seamstress, progressing to design, then later in Los Angeles, California working in the Garment District. She began her first line of dresses in 1956 with a $2,000 investment of her own savings. Her clothing-line "Edith Flagg, Inc." (1956–2000) manufactured in the United States from the 1950s until her retirement from the fashion industry in 2000. The brand was characterized by its wrinkle-resistant knitwear. As of 2012, the company reportedly afforded her a net worth of $100 million. Flagg was the first person to import polyester to the United States and popularize it. She discovered a type of polyester called Crimplene which was being produced by Imperial Chemical Industries out of Leeds, England. The material was used for parachutes and military uniforms during World War II, resulting in a post-war surplus. Flagg found the new fabric while vacationing in Switzerland in the 1960s. She signed an exclusive advertising contract with DuPont to import Crimplene from England and popularize under the name polyester. She also imported the synthetic fabric Dacron. Edith Flagg, Inc. expanded from a successful dress manufacturing company in Los Angeles to an international design house with offices and showrooms in New York, Chicago, Atlanta, Cleveland, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Dallas, Charlotte and London, as well as a factory in Hong Kong. She was an active contributor to "California Apparel News" and "Women's Wear Daily" in a weekly column titled "By the Way." Later, she often appeared on the television show "Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles" to offer business advice to her grandson, Josh Flagg. When Josh was fourteen, he wrote "A Simple Girl: Stories My Grandmother Told Me", a book about her survival during World War II and her career. The book was published in 2009, prior to the show. She was a donor to the United Jewish Welfare Fund, a Jewish non-profit organization, and the City of Hope, a private hospital in California. Flagg retired in 2000 to concentrate on her philanthropy, focusing on Jewish and medical causes. She was a donor to the United Jewish Welfare Fund, a Jewish non-profit organization, and the City of Hope, a private hospital in California of which she and her husband were also board members. Proceeds from her biography "A Simple Girl: Stories My Grandmother Told Me" were donated to the Jewish Federation. Flagg and her husband were the recipients of multiple awards from the National Conference of Christians and Jews and The United Jewish Welfare Fund. Flagg spoke Yiddish, Hebrew, Romanian, English, French, German and Dutch. She resided in a penthouse in The Century Towers on the Avenue of the Stars, Century City in Los Angeles, which she and her husband purchased from Jack Benny in 1976 for the highest price recorded for a condominium in Los Angeles up to that date. She died on August 13, 2014 in her penthouse in Century City of natural causes. She was ninety-four years old. She was buried at the Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery, a Jewish cemetery in Culver City, California, and the reception took place at the Hillcrest Country Club.

"Strange Days" is the third single from Canadian group Matthew Good Band's third studio album, "Beautiful Midnight". The song peaked at #6 on Canada's Rock chart, and is still one the band's most popular songs. The music video for "Strange Days" depicts a young homeless girl begging for change outside an office building, and being turned down by a woman passerby. Interspersed are "strange" happenings (such as the street turning to dusk) and a flashback sequence showing the girl running away from an abusive father. Throughout, a disheveled and unshaven Matthew Good is depicted interacting with the video's characters, though his presence goes unnoticed. At the climax of the song the woman leaves the building, once again dismissing the girl's and a still unnoticed Good's request for change. The young runaway watches as the woman steps off the curb into the path of an oncoming van. The runaway springs up to save the woman, sacrificing herself in the process. Fading in, the girl's ghost is shown watching paramedics as they close a body bag over her. She finally acknowledges Good, who is now clean shaven and wearing an all black suit, revealing his role as an angel. The final blurred shot depicts a little girl skipping down a tunnel toward a bright light and Good follows. The video reached #1 on the MuchMusic Countdown for two straight weeks between August 25 and September 1, 2000. The video was nominated for Best Video, Best Director and Best Cinematography at the 2000 Much Music Video Awards.

The Benelli Supernova is a pump action shotgun popular for hunting and self-defense, made by Italian firearm manufacturer Benelli Armi SpA. The Supernova's most innovative and distinguishing feature is a one-piece receiver and interchangeable stock with shim kit. It is known for its large trigger guard, extreme durability and reliability. Three main models are available as well as one variant: Recoil without the internal reducer is very harsh using the 3.5 inch shells. The shotgun is very light due to its composite/steel construction. This light weight shotgun lends itself to heavy recoil using heavy loads with high velocities. The recoil reducer helps reduce the felt recoil and allows the shooter to obtain a faster second shot. The recoil reducer consists of two elements; the apparatus that connects to the stock via the buttstock compartment, and the mercury element that is inserted into the recoil apparatus. This unit is available as a kit for installation in regular Nova shotguns as well. 

Lake Park, a mile-long park on a bluff above Lake Michigan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, is an urban park covering . Lake Park was designed in the late 19th century by Frederick Law Olmsted, who also designed Central Park in New York City along with many others. Believing that access to nature had a civilizing and restorative effect on the urban public, Olmsted designed Lake Park in the Romantic tradition, with a preference for natural (over formal) landscaping, winding paths, a variety of vistas, incorporation of wildlife, and a balance between active recreation and more passive enjoyment. Covering on the shore of Lake Michigan, the park is part of a mostly contiguous stretch of lakefront amenities that extend north from Milwaukee's downtown, including Bradford Beach, various parks, McKinley Marina, and the Milwaukee Art Museum. The park terrain includes both bluffs and ravines. In addition, Lake Park is home to the last remaining Indian mound in the city of Milwaukee. The others were destroyed by early settlers of the city and surrounding area. It also contains the North Point Lighthouse, which was built in 1855. A 6-hole golf course was built in 1903, expanding to 18 holes in 1930. In July 2016, Lake Park became a popular location for Poké-Stops in the game "Pokémon Go". In August 2016, the Milwaukee County Parks Department asked Niantic to remove the game stops until a permit was received, in compliance with a county ordinance.

Baron Franjo Jelačić Bužimski (English: Franz Jellacic, also Francis Yellachich of Buzhim or German: Franz Jellačić von Buzim, Hungarian: Ferenc Jellacsics de Buzim) (14 April 1746 – 4 February 1810) was a Croatian nobleman, a member of the House of Jelačić. He began his service in the Habsburg army as a Grenz infantry officer and fought against the Ottoman Turks. During the French Revolutionary Wars he received promotion to the rank of general officer and won an outstanding victory at Feldkirch. His later career proved that his martial abilities were limited. He twice led independent division-sized forces in the Napoleonic Wars, with unhappy results. He was Proprietor (Inhaber) of an Austrian infantry regiment from 1802 until his death. Born in 1746 at Petrinja in the Kingdom of Croatia of the Habsburg Monarchy, Jelačić became an officer cadet in the 1st Banal Grenz Infantry Regiment in 1763. He was appointed to Captain in 1772 and Major in 1783. He participated in the Austro-Turkish War (1787–91) and earned promotion to Oberstleutnant (lieutenant colonel). Still serving with the Grenz infantry of the Habsburg Monarchy army, Jelačić was elevated to the rank of Oberst (Colonel) in 1794. He fought in the War of the First Coalition on the upper Rhine River, at the Battle of Würzburg, and in other actions. His promotion to General-Major came through in March 1797. On 23 March 1799 at the Battle of Feldkirch in the Vorarlberg, Jelačić led his 5,500 soldiers to victory over 12,000 Frenchmen. The Austrians inflicted 3,000 casualties on their enemies at a cost of 900 killed and wounded. His command included the 3rd battalions of the "Kaunitz" Infantry Regiment Nr. 20, "De Vins" Infantry Regiment Nr. 37, and "Peterwardeiner" Grenz Regiment Nr. 9; the 2nd battalion of the "St. George" Gernz Infantry Nr. 6, and the 1st battalion of the "Broder" Grenz Infantry Regiment Nr. 7. The French were led by two future Marshals, André Masséna and Nicolas Oudinot. For this remarkable feat, he received promotion to Feldmarschall-Leutnant (Lieutenant Field Marshal) and was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Military Order of Maria Theresa. He was also given the title of hereditary baron. In 1802 Emperor Francis II appointed him proprietor of "Franz Jellačić" Infantry Regiment Nr. 62, a new Hungarian outfit. This unit should not be confused with the "Johann Jellačić" Infantry Regiment Nr. 53. In 1801, his wife Ana Portner von Höflein gave birth to their son Josip Jelačić, who also became a general and supported the Austrian regime during the Hungarian Revolution of 1848. In 1805, Jelačić commanded a corps in the army of Archduke Ferdinand Karl Joseph of Austria-Este and Karl Mack von Leiberich during the Ulm Campaign. At first his troops defended Biberach an der Riss. Around 6 October, Mack ordered Jelačić to move toward Ulm. At this time, Jelačić commanded 15,000 troops organized in 16 infantry battalions, six Jäger companies, and six cavalry squadrons. Emperor Napoleon I of France and his Grande Armée began to envelop the Austrian army. During the Battle of Wertingen on 8 October, the Battle of Günzburg on 9 October, and the Battle of Haslach-Jungingen on 11 October, the Grande Armée began to close in on its prey. On the 12th, Mack reorganized his army, making Jelačić one of four corps commanders, the others being Johann Sigismund Riesch, Franz von Werneck, and Karl Philipp, Prince of Schwarzenberg. He then ordered Jelačić to march south toward the Tyrol via Ochsenhausen for no explainable reason. Jelačić's troops escaped the Surrender of Ulm and made it to the Vorarlberg near Lake Constance. Napoleon assigned Marshal Pierre Augereau and his 12,000-man corps to hunt down Jelačić. In a series of small actions, Augereau drove the Austrians steadily back and managed to split their forces apart. Jelačić surrendered to Augereau with his remaining 4,000 troops in the Capitulation of Dornbirn on 13 November. Under the terms of surrender, the Austrians were repatriated to Bohemia with the promise not to fight against France for one year. One thousand of his cavalry, under General-Major Christian Wolfskeel von Reichenberg and Colonels Wartensleben and Kinsky, made a remarkable march through Bavaria and reached Bohemia in safety. Another portion of the Vorarlberg force under Prince Viktor Rohan tried to reach Venice but was caught short of its goal. Rohan surrendered to Laurent Gouvion Saint-Cyr and Jean Reynier at Castelfranco Veneto. Jelačić soon retired from military service. Brought out of retirement for the War of the Fifth Coalition, Jelačić took command of an infantry division in Johann von Hiller's VI Armeekorps. Originally, the division included two line infantry brigades under Konstantin von Ettingshausen and Josef Hoffmeister von Hoffeneck. On the outbreak of war, Hoffmeister's brigade was exchanged for the light brigade of Karl Dollmayer von Provenchères. The division was detached from VI Armeekorps and sent to occupy Munich. After the Austrian defeats at the battles of Abensberg, Landshut, and Eckmühl from 20 to 22 April 1809, Hiller retreated rapidly east and Jelačić was ordered back to Salzburg. Jelačić's 10,000-man division was assigned to the army of Archduke John of Austria. On 29 April the Bavarians occupied Salzburg as Jelačić slipped away to the south. He successfully defended the Lueg Pass near Golling an der Salzach on 1 and 4–5 May, twice defeating a Bavarian brigade. He sent Provenchères and almost all of his cavalry to join the main army. John desired Jelačić to join him, but his orders were ambiguously worded. Misinterpreting his orders as requiring him to hold his isolated position, he stayed in place until 19 May. When Jelačić finally realized his danger and withdrew toward Graz, it was too late. Believing his artillery to be of little use in the mountains, he sent most of it ahead of his column, retaining only four cannons. On 25 May, Paul Grenier's 12,000 to 15,000 strong Franco-Italian corps caught up with his division at the Battle of Sankt Michael near Leoben on 25 May. Without sufficient artillery and cavalry support, Jelačić's 9,000 troops were overwhelmed, suffering 423 dead, 1,137 wounded, and 4,963 captured. French losses numbered only 670. Historian Gunther E. Rothenberg called Jelačić "a remarkably unlucky and inept general." Jelačić and his survivors joined Archduke John's retreat across Hungary. At the Battle of Raab, he commanded 7,500 infantry of the right flank division. With help from the army reserve, his soldiers drove off the first Franco-Italian attack, but the action ended in an Austrian defeat. He commanded his division at the Battle of Wagram but John's army arrived too late on the field to have any effect on the outcome. He died on 4 February 1810 at Zalaapáti in modern-day Hungary. 

Cherenkov radiation (; Russian: Черенков) is electromagnetic radiation emitted when a charged particle (such as an electron) passes through a dielectric medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity (speed of propagation of a wave in a medium) of light in that medium. Special relativity is not violated since light travels slower in materials with refractive index greater than one, and it is the speed of light in a vacuum which cannot be reached (or exceeded) by particles with mass. A classic example of Cherenkov radiation is the characteristic blue glow of an underwater nuclear reactor. Its cause is similar to the cause of a sonic boom, the sharp sound heard when faster-than-sound movement occurs. The phenomenon is named for Soviet physicist Pavel Cherenkov, who shared the 1958 Nobel Prize in Physics for its discovery. The radiation is named after the Soviet scientist Pavel Cherenkov, the 1958 Nobel Prize winner, who was the first to detect it experimentally under the supervision of Sergey Vavilov at the Lebedev Institute in 1934. Therefore, it is also known as Vavilov–Cherenkov radiation. Cherenkov saw a faint bluish light around a radioactive preparation in water during experiments. His doctorate thesis was on luminescence of uranium salt solutions that were excited by gamma rays instead of less energetic visible light, as done commonly. He discovered the anisotropy of the radiation and came to the conclusion that the bluish glow was not a fluorescent phenomenon. A theory of this effect was later developed in 1937 within the framework of Einstein's special relativity theory by Cherenkov's colleagues Igor Tamm and Ilya Frank, who also shared the 1958 Nobel Prize. Cherenkov radiation as conical wave front had been theoretically predicted by the English polymath Oliver Heaviside in papers published between 1888 and 1889 and by Arnold Sommerfeld in 1904, but both had been quickly forgotten following the relativity theory's restriction of super-c particles until the 1970s. Marie Curie observed a pale blue light in a highly concentrated radium solution in 1910, but did not investigate its source. In 1926, the French radiotherapist Lucien Mallet described the luminous radiation of radium irradiating water having a continuous spectrum. In 2019, a team of researchers from Dartmouth’s and Dartmouth-Hitchcock's Norris Cotton Cancer Center discovered Cherenkov light being generated in the vitreous humor of patients undergoing radiotherapy. The light was observed using a camera imaging system called a CDose, which is specially designed to view light emissions from biological systems. For decades, patients had reported phenomena such as “flashes of bright or blue light” when receiving radiation treatments for brain cancer, but the effects had never been experimentally observed. While the speed of light "in a vacuum" is a universal constant (), the speed in a material may be significantly less, as it is perceived to be slowed by the medium. For example, in water it is only 0.75"c". Matter can accelerate beyond this speed (although still less than "c", the speed of light in vacuum) during nuclear reactions and in particle accelerators. Cherenkov radiation results when a charged particle, most commonly an electron, travels through a dielectric (can be polarized electrically) medium with a speed greater than light's speed in that medium. A common analogy is the sonic boom of a supersonic aircraft. The sound waves generated by the aircraft travel at the speed of sound, which is slower than the aircraft, and cannot propagate forward from the aircraft, instead forming a shock front. In a similar way, a charged particle can generate a light shock wave as it travels through an insulator. The velocity that must be exceeded is the phase velocity of light rather than the group velocity of light. The phase velocity can be altered dramatically by using a periodic medium, and in that case one can even achieve Cherenkov radiation with "no" minimum particle velocity, a phenomenon known as the Smith–Purcell effect. In a more complex periodic medium, such as a photonic crystal, one can also obtain a variety of other anomalous Cherenkov effects, such as radiation in a backwards direction (see below) whereas ordinary Cherenkov radiation forms an acute angle with the particle velocity. In their original work on the theoretical foundations of Cherenkov radiation, Tamm and Frank wrote,"This peculiar radiation can evidently not be explained by any common mechanism such as the interaction of the fast electron with individual atom or as radiative scattering of electrons on atomic nuclei. On the other hand, the phenomenon can be explained both qualitatively and quantitatively if one takes into account the fact that an electron moving in a medium does radiate light even if it is moving uniformly provided that its velocity is greater than the velocity of light in the medium.". In the figure on the geometry, the particle (red arrow) travels in a medium with speed formula_1 such that where formula_3 is speed of light in vacuum, and formula_4 is the refractive index of the medium. If the medium is water, the condition is formula_5, since formula_6 for water at 20 °C. We define the ratio between the speed of the particle and the speed of light as The emitted light waves (denoted by blue arrows) travel at speed The left corner of the triangle represents the location of the superluminal particle at some initial moment ("t" = 0). The right corner of the triangle is the location of the particle at some later time t. In the given time "t", the particle travels the distance whereas the emitted electromagnetic waves are constricted to travel the distance So the emission angle results in Cherenkov radiation can also radiate in an arbitrary direction using properly engineered one dimensional metamaterials. The latter is designed to introduce a gradient of phase retardation along the trajectory of the fast travelling particle (formula_12 ), reversing or steering Cherenkov emission at arbitrary angles given by the generalized relation: Note that since this ratio is independent of time, one can take arbitrary times and achieve similar triangles. The angle stays the same, meaning that subsequent waves generated between the initial time "t"=0 and final time "t" will form similar triangles with coinciding right endpoints to the one shown. A reverse Cherenkov effect can be experienced using materials called negative-index metamaterials (materials with a subwavelength microstructure that gives them an effective "average" property very different from their constituent materials, in this case having negative permittivity and negative permeability). This means that, when a charged particle (usually electrons) passes through a medium at a speed greater than the phase velocity of light in that medium, that particle emits trailing radiation from its progress through the medium rather than in front of it (as is the case in normal materials with, both permittivity and permeability positive). One can also obtain such reverse-cone Cherenkov radiation in non-metamaterial periodic media where the periodic structure is on the same scale as the wavelength, so it cannot be treated as an effectively homogeneous metamaterial. The Cherenkov effect can occur in vacuum. In a slow-wave structure, like in a TWT (Traveling Wave Tube), the phase velocity decreases and the velocity of charged particles can exceed the phase velocity while remaining lower than formula_3. In such a system, this effect can be derived from conservation of the energy and momentum where the momentum of a photon should be formula_15 (formula_16 is phase constant) rather than the de Broglie relation formula_17. This type of radiation (VCR) is used to generate high-power microwaves. The frequency spectrum of Cherenkov radiation by a particle is given by the Frank–Tamm formula: The Frank–Tamm formula describes the amount of energy formula_19 emitted from Cherenkov radiation, per unit length traveled formula_20 and per frequency formula_21. formula_22 is the permeability and formula_23 is the index of refraction of the material the charge particle moves through. formula_24 is the electric charge of the particle, formula_25 is the speed of the particle, and formula_3 is the speed of light in vacuum. Unlike fluorescence or emission spectra that have characteristic spectral peaks, Cherenkov radiation is continuous. Around the visible spectrum, the relative intensity per unit frequency is approximately proportional to the frequency. That is, higher frequencies (shorter wavelengths) are more intense in Cherenkov radiation. This is why visible Cherenkov radiation is observed to be brilliant blue. In fact, most Cherenkov radiation is in the ultraviolet spectrum—it is only with sufficiently accelerated charges that it even becomes visible; the sensitivity of the human eye peaks at green, and is very low in the violet portion of the spectrum. There is a cut-off frequency above which the equation formula_27 can no longer be satisfied. The refractive index formula_4 varies with frequency (and hence with wavelength) in such a way that the intensity cannot continue to increase at ever shorter wavelengths, even for very relativistic particles (where v/c is close to 1). At X-ray frequencies, the refractive index becomes less than 1 (note that in media, the phase velocity may exceed "c" without violating relativity) and hence no X-ray emission (or shorter wavelength emissions such as gamma rays) would be observed. However, X-rays can be generated at special frequencies just below the frequencies corresponding to core electronic transitions in a material, as the index of refraction is often greater than 1 just below a resonant frequency (see Kramers-Kronig relation and anomalous dispersion). As in sonic booms and bow shocks, the angle of the shock cone is directly related to the velocity of the disruption. The Cherenkov angle is zero at the threshold velocity for the emission of Cherenkov radiation. The angle takes on a maximum as the particle speed approaches the speed of light. Hence, observed angles of incidence can be used to compute the direction and speed of a Cherenkov radiation-producing charge. Cherenkov radiation can be generated in the eye by charged particles hitting the vitreous humour, giving the impression of flashes, as in cosmic ray visual phenomena and possibly some observations of criticality accidents. Cherenkov radiation is widely used to facilitate the detection of small amounts and low concentrations of biomolecules. Radioactive atoms such as phosphorus-32 are readily introduced into biomolecules by enzymatic and synthetic means and subsequently may be easily detected in small quantities for the purpose of elucidating biological pathways and in characterizing the interaction of biological molecules such as affinity constants and dissociation rates. More recently, Cherenkov light has been used to image substances in the body. These discoveries have led to intense interest around the idea of using this light signal to quantify and/or detect radiation in the body, either from internal sources such as injected radiopharmaceuticals or from external beam radiotherapy in oncology. Radioisotopes such as the positron emitters F and N or beta emitters P or Y have measurable Cherenkov emission and isotopes F and I have been imaged in humans for diagnostic value demonstration. External beam radiation therapy has been shown to induce a substantial amount of Cherenkov light in the tissue being treated, due to the photon beam energy levels used in the 6 MeV to 18 MeV ranges. The secondary electrons induced by these high energy x-rays result in the Cherenkov light emission, where the detected signal can be imaged at the entry and exit surfaces of the tissue. Cherenkov radiation is used to detect high-energy charged particles. In pool-type nuclear reactors, beta particles (high-energy electrons) are released as the fission products decay. The glow continues after the chain reaction stops, dimming as the shorter-lived products decay. Similarly, Cherenkov radiation can characterize the remaining radioactivity of spent fuel rods. This phenomenon is used to verify the presence of spent nuclear fuel in spent fuel pools for nuclear safeguards purposes. When a high-energy (TeV) gamma photon or cosmic ray interacts with the Earth's atmosphere, it may produce an electron-positron pair with enormous velocities. The Cherenkov radiation emitted in the atmosphere by these charged particles is used to determine the direction and energy of the cosmic ray or gamma ray, which is used for example in the Imaging Atmospheric Cherenkov Technique (IACT), by experiments such as VERITAS, H.E.S.S., MAGIC. Cherenkov radiation emitted in tanks filled with water by those charged particles reaching earth is used for the same goal by the Extensive Air Shower experiment HAWC, the Pierre Auger Observatory and other projects. Similar methods are used in very large neutrino detectors, such as the Super-Kamiokande, the Sudbury Neutrino Observatory (SNO) and IceCube. Other projects operated in the past applying related techniques, such as STACEE, a former solar tower refurbished to work as a non-imaging Cherenkov observatory, which was located in New Mexico. Astrophysics observatories using the Cherenkov technique to measure air showers are key to determine the properties of astronomical objects that emit Very High Energy gamma rays, such as supernova remnants and blazars. Cherenkov radiation is commonly used in experimental particle physics for particle identification. One could measure (or put limits on) the velocity of an electrically charged elementary particle by the properties of the Cherenkov light it emits in a certain medium. If the momentum of the particle is measured independently, one could compute the mass of the particle by its momentum and velocity (see four-momentum), and hence identify the particle. The simplest type of particle identification device based on a Cherenkov radiation technique is the threshold counter, which answers whether the velocity of a charged particle is lower or higher than a certain value (formula_29, where formula_3 is the speed of light, and formula_4 is the refractive index of the medium) by looking at whether this particle emits Cherenkov light in a certain medium. Knowing particle momentum, one can separate particles lighter than a certain threshold from those heavier than the threshold. The most advanced type of a detector is the RICH, or Ring-imaging Cherenkov detector, developed in the 1980s. In a RICH detector, a cone of Cherenkov light is produced when a high-speed charged particle traverses a suitable medium, often called radiator. This light cone is detected on a position sensitive planar photon detector, which allows reconstructing a ring or disc, whose radius is a measure for the Cherenkov emission angle. Both focusing and proximity-focusing detectors are in use. In a focusing RICH detector, the photons are collected by a spherical mirror and focused onto the photon detector placed at the focal plane. The result is a circle with a radius independent of the emission point along the particle track. This scheme is suitable for low refractive index radiators—i.e. gases—due to the larger radiator length needed to create enough photons. In the more compact proximity-focusing design, a thin radiator volume emits a cone of Cherenkov light which traverses a small distance—the proximity gap—and is detected on the photon detector plane. The image is a ring of light whose radius is defined by the Cherenkov emission angle and the proximity gap. The ring thickness is determined by the thickness of the radiator. An example of a proximity gap RICH detector is the High Momentum Particle Identification Detector (HMPID), a detector currently under construction for ALICE (A Large Ion Collider Experiment), one of the six experiments at the LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN. 

Serpent Safari was a reptile zoo located inside the Gurnee Mills Mall in Gurnee, Illinois, a suburb of Chicago, Illinois. The zoo advertised itself as "America's Finest Reptile Zoo." The zoo housed some of the rarest reptiles, including the world's heaviest snake (over 375 lbs. as of Feb. 2010), a rare albino alligator, and a 150-year-old alligator snapping turtle. A gift shop offering pets, a photo area where guests could get their photos taken with a large python or boa, and a reptile zoo with guided tours were provided. A female Burmese Python named "Baby" that lived 27 years at the Serpent Safari was confirmed by Guinness World Records as the heaviest living snake in captivity, weighing . After death, her actual length was determined to be 5.74 m (18 ft 10 in) which is the maximum length record for this species so far. 

The Battle of Cookes Canyon was a military engagement fought between settlers from Confederate Arizona and Chiricahua Apaches in August 1861. It occurred about northwest of Mesilla, in Cookes Canyon. The exact date of the battle is unknown. The battle occurred in the larger context of both the Apache Wars and the American Civil War. In early August, a group of Arizonan refugees, from the Tubac area, abandoned their village due to the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Fort Buchanan and the Siege of Tubac which left their homes burned. The bunch was known as the Ake Party, and their destination was the Rio Grande near Mesilla. The wagon train consisted of six double wagons, two buggies, and one single wagon when it reached Tucson from the surrounding region. At Tucson, several other people joined the procession, which including Moses Carson, the half-brother of the famous scout and soldier, Kit Carson. The party was now composed of twenty-four men, sixteen women, seven children, along with 400 head of cattle and 900 head of sheep, as well as horses and goats. The settlers, who were mostly miners and ranchers, left Tucson around August 15, 1861. The large number of livestock would present an irresistible temptation to the Chiricahua Apache warriors under Cochise and Mangas Coloradas. The journey was uneventful until the party crossed the Mimbres River and made for the springs at Cooke's Canyon within Traditional Arizona and the present day New Mexico. It is unknown whether or not Cochise and Mangas Coloradas were leading the Apache warriors. Most likely they were, as the commanders of the combined Apache force that operated primarily in present-day southwestern New Mexico where Cooke's Canyon is located. When the last wagon had entered the canyon, the Apaches, estimated to number about 100, sprang their ambush by attacking and scattering the large group of livestock. They then charged the wagons, and were stopped from reaching them after a series of mounted countercharges by several men of the party. The wagons were maneuvered into a circle and the settlers withstood a siege that lasted the remainder of the day. Eventually the Apaches took to the surrounding slopes, firing both arrows and bullets at long range. The settlers responded from their wagon positions, killing several of the attackers who approached them on horseback and foot. Finally, toward the end of the day the Apaches retreated, taking their plunder of 400 cattle and 900 sheep with them. The settlers withdrew to the Mimbres. They had suffered a loss of four men killed and eight wounded. The last wagon in the party, carrying most of the women and children, had turned about after the first shots were fired and fled back toward the Mimbres River. Unmolested by the Apaches, this wagon reached the settlement on the Mimbres safely and sent a plea for help to Pinos Altos, where the Arizona Guards were stationed. The Confederate troops responded to the report, leading to the Battle of the Florida Mountains two days later. During the summer of 1861, the Apache warriors of Mangas Coloradas and Cochise massacred several other groups of settlers at Cookes Canyon. Apache warriors killed and mutilated a party of seven near the east end of the canyon. Near the same location, they massacred and mutilated nine Mexican herdsmen and stole their forty head of cattle. Three whites of the same party were taken prisoner, tortured and killed later on. Fourteen American settlers were murdered on either July 25 or 26, 1861 and discovered by the Los Angeles Mounted Rifles, soon after. Again, near that same location they attempted to destroy the Ake Party. Over the months, Apache warriors left what one chronicler called "many bones, skulls, & graves" in Cookes Canyon. Eventually, the Apaches killed as many as 100 Americans and Mexicans in Cookes Canyon, making it the most feared passage on the trail from Mesilla to Tucson. According to historian Dan Thrapp, 150 whites were killed within sixty days during this period. Around the same time, the Mexican governor of Sonora estimated that 500 to 600 of his people were killed by the Apache on their side of the border. 

Ludwig II (; ; 25 August 1845 – 13 June 1886) was King of Bavaria from 1864 until his death in 1886. He is sometimes called the Swan King or ("the Fairy Tale King"). He also held the titles of Count Palatine of the Rhine, Duke of Bavaria, Duke of Franconia, and Duke in Swabia. Ludwig succeeded to the throne in 1864, aged 18. Two years later, Bavaria and Austria fought a war against Prussia lasting only a matter of weeks, which they lost. However, in the Franco-Prussian War of 1870, Bavaria sided with Prussia against France, and after the Prussian victory, it became part of the new German Empire led by Prussia. Though Bavaria retained a degree of autonomy on some matters within the new German Reich, Ludwig increasingly withdrew from day-to-day affairs of state in favour of extravagant artistic and architectural projects. He commissioned the construction of two lavish palaces and Neuschwanstein Castle, and he was a devoted patron of the composer Richard Wagner. Ludwig spent all his royal revenues (although not state funds as is commonly thought) on these projects, borrowed extensively, and defied all attempts by his ministers to restrain him. This extravagance was used against him to declare him insane, an accusation that has since come under scrutiny. Today, his architectural and artistic legacy includes many of Bavaria's most important tourist attractions. Born at Nymphenburg Palace (today located in suburban Munich), he was the elder son of Maximilian II of Bavaria and Marie of Prussia, Crown Prince and Princess of Bavaria, who became King and Queen in 1848 after the abdication of the former's father, Ludwig I, during the German Revolution. His parents intended to name him Otto, but his grandfather insisted that his grandson be named after him, since their common birthday, 25 August, is the feast day of Saint Louis IX of France, patron saint of Bavaria (with "Ludwig" being the German form of "Louis"). His younger brother, born three years later, was named Otto. Like many young heirs in an age when kings governed most of Europe, Ludwig was continually reminded of his royal status. King Maximilian wanted to instruct both of his sons in the burdens of royal duty from an early age. Ludwig was both extremely indulged and severely controlled by his tutors and subjected to a strict regimen of study and exercise. Some point to these stresses of growing up in a royal family as the causes for much of his odd behavior as an adult. Ludwig was not close to either of his parents. King Maximilian's advisers had suggested that on his daily walks he might like, at times, to be accompanied by his future successor. The King replied, "But what am I to say to him? After all, my son takes no interest in what other people tell him." Later, Ludwig would refer to his mother as "my predecessor's consort". He was far closer to his grandfather, the deposed and notorious King Ludwig I. Ludwig's childhood years did have happy moments. He lived for much of the time at Castle Hohenschwangau, a fantasy castle his father had built near the Alpsee (Alp Lake) near Füssen. It was decorated in the Gothic Revival style with many frescoes depicting heroic German sagas. The family also visited Lake Starnberg. As an adolescent, Ludwig became close friends with his aide de camp, Prince Paul, a member of the wealthy Bavarian Thurn und Taxis family. The two young men rode together, read poetry aloud, and staged scenes from the Romantic operas of Richard Wagner. The friendship ended when Paul became engaged in 1866 with a commoner. During his youth, Ludwig also initiated a lifelong friendship with his cousin Duchess Elisabeth in Bavaria, later Empress of Austria. Crown Prince Ludwig was in his 19th year when his father died after a three-day illness, and he ascended the Bavarian throne. Although he was not prepared for high office, his youth and brooding good looks made him popular in Bavaria and elsewhere. He continued the state policies of his father and retained his ministers. His real interests were in art, music, and architecture. One of the first acts of his reign, a few months after his accession, was to summon Wagner to his court. Also in 1864, he laid the foundation stone of a new Court Theatre, now the "Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz" ("Gärtnerplatz-Theater"). Ludwig was notably eccentric in ways that made serving as Bavaria's head of state problematic. He disliked large public functions and avoided formal social events whenever possible, preferring a life of seclusion that he pursued with various creative projects. He last inspected a military parade on 22 August 1875 and last gave a court banquet on 10 February 1876. His mother had foreseen difficulties for Ludwig when she recorded her concern for her extremely introverted and creative son who spent much time day-dreaming. These idiosyncrasies, combined with the fact that Ludwig avoided Munich and participating in the government there at all costs, caused considerable tension with the king's government ministers, but did not cost him popularity among the citizens of Bavaria. The king enjoyed traveling in the Bavarian countryside and chatting with farmers and labourers he met along the way. He also delighted in rewarding those who were hospitable to him during his travels with lavish gifts. He is still remembered in Bavaria as "Unser Kini" ("our cherished king" in the Bavarian dialect). Unification with Prussia took center stage from 1866. In the Austro-Prussian War, which began in August, Ludwig supported Austria against Prussia. Austria and Bavaria were defeated, and Bavaria was forced to sign a mutual defense treaty with Prussia. When the Franco-Prussian War broke out in 1870, Bavaria was required to fight alongside Prussia. After the Prussian victory over France, Bismarck moved to complete the Unification of Germany. In November 1870, Bavaria joined the North German Confederation, thus losing its status as an independent kingdom. However, the Bavarian delegation under Minister-President Count Otto von Bray-Steinburg secured privilleged status for Bavaria within the empire ("Reservatrechte"). Bavaria retained its own diplomatic corps and its own army, which would come under Prussian command only in times of war. In December 1870, Bismarck used financial concessions to induce Ludwig with the support of the king's equerry Maximilian Count von Holnstein to write the so-called "Kaiserbrief", a letter endorsing the creation of the German Empire with King Wilhelm I of Prussia as Emperor. Nevertheless, Ludwig regretted Bavaria's loss of independence and refused to attend Wilhelm's 18 January proclamation as German Emperor in the Palace of Versailles. Ludwig's brother Prince Otto and his uncle Luitpold went, instead. Otto criticized the celebration as ostentatious and heartless in a letter to his brother. The greatest stress of Ludwig's early reign was pressure to produce an heir. This issue came to the forefront in 1867. Ludwig became engaged to Duchess Sophie in Bavaria, his cousin and the youngest sister of his dear friend, Empress Elisabeth of Austria. They shared a deep interest in the works of Wagner. The engagement was announced on 22 January 1867; a few days earlier, Ludwig had written Sophie, "The main substance of our relationship has always been … Richard Wagner's remarkable and deeply moving destiny." However, Ludwig repeatedly postponed the wedding date, and finally cancelled the engagement in October. After the engagement was broken off, Ludwig wrote to his former fiancée, "My beloved Elsa! Your cruel father has torn us apart. Eternally yours, Heinrich." (The names Elsa and Heinrich came from characters in Wagner's opera "Lohengrin".) Sophie later married Prince Ferdinand, Duke of Alençon, grandson of French King Louis Philippe I, at Possenhofen Castle at which Ludwig II unexpectedly attended the reception. Ludwig never married nor had any known mistresses. It is known from his diary (which began in the 1860s), private letters, and other surviving personal documents that he had strong homosexual desires. He struggled all his life to suppress those desires and remain true to the teachings of the Catholic Church. Homosexuality had not been punishable in Bavaria since 1813, but the Unification of Germany in 1871 instated Paragraph 175, which criminalized homosexual acts between males under Prussian hegemony. In intensely Catholic and socially conservative 19th-century Bavaria, the scandal of a homosexual monarch would have been intolerable. Throughout his reign, Ludwig had a succession of close friendships with men, including his chief equerry and master of the horse, Richard Hornig (1841–1911), the Bavarian prince Paul von Thurn und Taxis, the Hungarian theater actor Josef Kainz, and his courtier Alfons Weber (b. 1862). Ludwig's original diaries from 1869 onward were lost during World War II, and all that remain today are copies of entries made during the 1886 plot to depose him. Some earlier diaries have survived in the "Geheimes Hausarchiv" ("secret archives") in Munich, and extracts starting in 1858 were published by Evers in 1986. After 1871, Ludwig largely withdrew from politics, and devoted himself to his personal creative projects, most famously his castles, for which he personally approved every detail of the architecture, decoration, and furnishing. Ludwig was intensely interested in the operas of Richard Wagner. This interest began when Ludwig first saw "Lohengrin" at the impressionable age of 15, followed by "Tannhäuser" ten months later. Wagner's operas appealed to the king's fantasy-filled imagination. Wagner had a notorious reputation as a political radical and philanderer, and was constantly on the run from creditors. However, on 4 May 1864, the 51-year-old Wagner was given an unprecedented 1¾ hour audience with Ludwig in the Royal Palace in Munich; later, the composer wrote of his first meeting with Ludwig: "Alas, he is so handsome and wise, soulful and lovely, that I fear that his life must melt away in this vulgar world like a fleeting dream of the gods." Ludwig was probably the savior of Wagner's career. Without Ludwig, Wagner's later operas are unlikely to have been composed, much less premiered at the prestigious Munich Royal Court Theatre (now the Bavarian State Opera). A year after meeting the King, Wagner presented his latest work, "Tristan und Isolde", in Munich to great acclaim. However, the composer's perceived extravagant and scandalous behaviour in the capital was unsettling for the conservative people of Bavaria, and the King was forced to ask Wagner to leave the city six months later, in December 1865. Ludwig considered abdicating to follow Wagner, but Wagner persuaded him to stay. Ludwig provided the Tribschen residence for Wagner in Switzerland. Wagner completed "Die Meistersinger" there; it was premiered in Munich in 1868. When Wagner returned to his "Ring Cycle", Ludwig demanded "special previews" of the first two works ("Das Rheingold" and "Die Walküre") at Munich in 1869 and 1870. Wagner, however, was now planning his great personal opera house at Bayreuth. Ludwig initially refused to support the grandiose project. However, when Wagner exhausted all other sources, he appealed to Ludwig, who loaned him 100,000 thalers to complete the work. Ludwig also paid for the Wahnfried villa for Wagner and his family to reside in, constructed 1872–74. In 1876, Ludwig attended the dress rehearsal and third public performance of the complete Ring Cycle at the Festspielhaus. Ludwig's interest in theater was by no means confined to Wagner. In 1867, he appointed Karl von Perfall as director of his new court theater. Ludwig wished to introduce Munich theater-goers to the best of European drama. Perfall, under Ludwig's supervision, introduced them to Shakespeare, Calderón, Mozart, Gluck, Ibsen, Weber, and many others. He also raised the standard of interpretation of Schiller, Molière, and Corneille. Between 1872 and 1885, the King had 209 private performances ("Separatvorstellungen") given for himself alone or with a guest, in the two court theaters, comprising 44 operas (28 by Wagner, including eight of "Parsifal"), 11 ballets, and 154 plays (the principal theme being Bourbon France) at a cost of 97,300 marks. This was not due so much to misanthropy, but as the King complained to the theatre actor-manager Ernst Possart: "I can get no sense of illusion in the theatre so long as people keep staring at me, and follow my every expression through their opera-glasses. I want to look myself, not to be a spectacle for the masses." Ludwig used his personal fortune (supplemented annually from 1873 by 270,000 marks from the "Welfenfonds") to fund the construction of a series of elaborate castles. In 1867, he visited Eugène Viollet-le-Duc's work at Pierrefonds, and the Palace of Versailles in France, as well as the Wartburg near Eisenach in Thuringia, which largely influenced the style of his construction. In his letters, Ludwig marvelled at how the French had magnificently built up and glorified their culture (e.g., architecture, art, and music) and how miserably lacking Bavaria was in comparison. His dream became to accomplish the same for Bavaria. These projects provided employment for many hundreds of local laborers and artisans and brought a considerable flow of money to the relatively poor regions where his castles were built. Figures for the total costs between 1869 and 1886 for the building and equipping of each castle were published in 1968: Schloß Neuschwanstein 6,180,047 marks; Schloß Linderhof 8,460,937 marks (a large portion being expended on the Venus Grotto); Schloß Herrenchiemsee (from 1873) 16,579,674 marks In order to give an equivalent for the era, the British Pound sterling, being the monetary hegemon of the time, had a fixed exchange rate (based on the gold standard) at £1 = 20.43 Goldmarks. In 1868, Ludwig commissioned the first drawings for his buildings, starting with Neuschwanstein and Herrenchiemsee, though work on the latter did not commence until 1878. Schloss Neuschwanstein ("New Swanstone Castle") is a dramatic Romanesque fortress with soaring fairy-tale towers. It is situated on an Alpine crag above Ludwig's childhood home, Castle Hohenschwangau ("Upper Swan County Palace"). Hohenschwangau was a medieval knights' castle that his parents had purchased. Ludwig reputedly had seen the location and conceived of building a castle there while still a boy. In 1869, Ludwig oversaw the laying of the cornerstone for Schloss Neuschwanstein on a breathtaking mountaintop site. The walls of Neuschwanstein are decorated with frescoes depicting scenes from the legends used in Wagner's operas, including "Tannhäuser," "Tristan und Isolde," "Lohengrin," "Parsifal," and the somewhat less than mystic "Die Meistersinger". In 1878, construction was completed on Ludwig's Schloss Linderhof, an ornate palace in neo-French Rococo style, with handsome formal gardens. The grounds contained a Venus grotto lit by electricity, where Ludwig was rowed in a boat shaped like a shell. After seeing the Bayreuth performances, Ludwig built "Hundinghütte" ("Hunding's Hut", based on the stage set of the first act of Wagner's "Die Walküre") in the forest near Linderhof, complete with an artificial tree and a sword embedded in it. (In "Die Walküre", Siegmund pulls the sword from the tree.) Hunding's Hut was destroyed in 1945, but a replica was constructed at Linderhof in 1990. In 1877, Ludwig had "Einsiedlei des Gurnemanz" (a small hermitage, as seen in the third act of "Parsifal") erected near Hunding's Hut, with a meadow of spring flowers. The king would retire to read. (A replica made in 2000 can now be seen in the park at Linderhof.) Nearby a Moroccan House, purchased at the Paris World Fair in 1878, was erected alongside the mountain road. Sold in 1891 and taken to Oberammergau, it was purchased by the government in 1980 and re-erected in the park at Linderhof after extensive restoration. Inside the palace, iconography reflected Ludwig's fascination with the absolutist government of "Ancien régime" France. Ludwig saw himself as the "Moon King", a romantic shadow of the earlier "Sun King", Louis XIV of France. From Linderhof, Ludwig enjoyed moonlit sleigh rides in an elaborate 18th-century sleigh, complete with footmen in 18th-century livery. In 1878, construction began on Herrenchiemsee, a partial replica of the palace at Versailles, sited on the Herreninsel in the Chiemsee. It was built as Ludwig's tribute to Louis XIV of France, the magnificent "Sun King". Only the central portion of the palace was built; all construction halted on Ludwig's death. What exists of Herrenchiemsee comprises , a "copy in miniature" compared with Versailles' 551,112 ft². The following year, Ludwig finished the construction of the royal apartment in the Residenz Palace in Munich, to which he had added an opulent conservatory or winter garden on the palace roof. It was started in 1867 as quite a small structure, but after extensions in 1868 and 1871, the dimensions reached 69.5 x 17.2 x 9.5 m. It featured an ornamental lake complete with skiff, a painted panorama of the Himalayas as a backdrop, an Indian fisher-hut of bamboo, a Moorish kiosk, and an exotic tent. The roof was a technically advanced metal and glass construction. The winter garden was closed in June 1886, partly dismantled the following year, and demolished in 1897. In the 1880s, Ludwig continued his elaborate schemes. He planned the construction of a new castle on Falkenstein ("Falcon Rock") near Pfronten in the Allgäu (a place he knew well: a diary entry for 16 October 1867 reads "Falkenstein wild, romantic"). The first design was a sketch by Christian Jank in 1883 "very much like the Townhall of Liège". Subsequent designs showed a modest villa with a square tower and a small Gothic castle. By 1885, a road and water supply had been provided at Falkenstein but the old ruins remained untouched. Ludwig also proposed a Byzantine palace in the Graswangtal, and a Chinese summer palace by the Plansee in Tyrol. These projects never got beyond initial plans. For Berg Castle, Ludwig had a fifth tower constructed for it called "Isolde" and used the castle frequently as his summer residence. When Empress Maria Alexandrovna of Russia visited Berg in 1868, he had the castle magnificently decorated for the duration of her stay there; the castle otherwise, by his standards, was modestly furnished. Although the king had paid for his pet projects out of his own funds and not the state coffers, that did not necessarily spare Bavaria from financial fallout. By 1885, the king was 14 million marks in debt, had borrowed heavily from his family, and rather than economizing, as his financial ministers advised him, he planned further opulent designs without pause. He demanded that loans be sought from all of Europe's royalty, and remained aloof from matters of state. Feeling harassed and irritated by his ministers, he considered dismissing the entire cabinet and replacing them with fresh faces. The cabinet decided to act first. Seeking a cause to depose Ludwig by constitutional means, the rebelling ministers decided on the rationale that he was mentally ill, and unable to rule. They asked Ludwig's uncle, Prince Luitpold, to step into the royal vacancy once Ludwig was deposed. Luitpold agreed, on condition the conspirators produced reliable proof that the king was, in fact, helplessly insane. Between January and March 1886, the conspirators assembled the "" or Medical Report, on Ludwig's fitness to rule. Most of the details in the report were compiled by Maximilian Count von Holnstein, who was disillusioned with Ludwig and actively sought his downfall. Holnstein used bribery and his high rank to extract a long list of complaints, accounts, and gossip about Ludwig from among the king's servants. The litany of supposed bizarre behavior included his pathological shyness, his avoidance of state business, his complex and expensive flights of fancy, dining out of doors in cold weather and wearing heavy overcoats in summer, sloppy and childish table manners, dispatching servants on lengthy and expensive voyages to research architectural details in foreign lands; and abusive, violent threats to his servants. The degree to which these accusations were accurate may never be known. The conspirators approached Bismarck, who doubted the report's veracity, calling it "rakings from the King's wastepaper-basket and cupboards." Bismarck commented after reading the report that "the Ministers wish to sacrifice the King, otherwise they have no chance of saving themselves." He suggested that the matter be brought before the Bavarian Diet and discussed there, but did not stop the ministers from carrying out their plan. In early June, the report was finalized and signed by a panel of four psychiatrists: Dr. Bernhard von Gudden, chief of the Munich Asylum; Dr. Hubert von Grashey (who was Gudden's son-in-law); and their colleagues, Dr. Friedrich Wilhelm Hagen and Dr. Max Hubrich. The report declared in its final sentences that the king suffered from paranoia, and concluded, "Suffering from such a disorder, freedom of action can no longer be allowed and Your Majesty is declared incapable of ruling, which incapacity will be not only for a year's duration, but for the length of Your Majesty's life." The men had never met the king, except for Gudden, only once, 12 years earlier, and none had ever examined him. Questions about the lack of medical diagnosis make the legality of the deposition controversial. Adding to the controversy are the mysterious circumstances under which King Ludwig died. (Today, the claim of paranoia is not considered correct; Ludwig's behavior is rather interpreted as a schizotypal personality disorder and he may also have suffered from Pick's disease during his last years, an assumption supported by a frontotemporal lobar degeneration mentioned in the autopsy report.) Ludwig's younger only brother and successor, Otto, was considered insane, providing a convenient basis for the claim of hereditary insanity. At 4 am on 10 June 1886, a government commission including Holnstein and Gudden arrived at Neuschwanstein to deliver the document of deposition to the King formally and to place him in custody. Tipped off an hour or two earlier by a faithful servant, his coachman Fritz Osterholzer, Ludwig ordered the local police to protect him, and the commissioners were turned back from the castle gate at gunpoint. In an infamous sideshow, the commissioners were attacked by the 47-year-old baroness Spera von Truchseß, out of loyalty to the king, who flailed at the men with her umbrella and then rushed to the king's apartments to identify the conspirators. Ludwig then had the commissioners arrested, but after holding them captive for several hours, released them. Prince Ludwig Ferdinand was the only member of the Bavarian royal family who always remained on friendly terms with his cousin (with the exception of Elisabeth, Empress of Austria), so Ludwig II wrote him a telegram; the latter immediately intended to follow this call, but was prevented from leaving Nymphenburg Palace by his uncle Luitpold, who was about to take over government as the ruling Prince Regent. That same day, the government under Minister-President Johann von Lutz publicly proclaimed Luitpold as Prince Regent. The king's friends and allies urged him to flee, or to show himself in Munich, and thus regain the support of the people. Ludwig hesitated, instead issuing a statement, allegedly drafted by his aide-de-camp Count Alfred Dürckheim, which was published by a Bamberg newspaper on 11 June: The government succeeded in suppressing the statement by seizing most copies of the newspaper and handbills. Anton Sailer's pictorial biography of the King contains a photograph of this rare document. The authenticity of the Royal Proclamation is doubted, however, as it is dated 9 June, before the commission arrived, it uses "I" instead of the royal "We" and orthographic errors are included. As the king dithered, his support waned. Peasants who rallied to his cause were dispersed, and the police who guarded his castle were replaced by a police detachment of 36 men who sealed off all entrances to the castle. Eventually, the king decided he would try to escape, but he was too late. In the early hours of 12 June, a second commission arrived. The King was seized just after midnight and at 4 am was taken to a waiting carriage. He asked Dr. Gudden, "How can you declare me insane? After all, you have never seen or examined me before," only to be told that "it was unnecessary; the documentary evidence [the servants' reports] is very copious and completely substantiated. It is overwhelming." Ludwig was transported to Berg Castle on the shores of Lake Starnberg, south of Munich. On the afternoon of the next day, 13 June 1886, Dr. Gudden accompanied Ludwig on a stroll in the grounds of Berg Castle. They were escorted by two attendants. On their return, Gudden expressed optimism to other doctors concerning the treatment of his royal patient. Following dinner, at around 6 pm, Ludwig asked Gudden to accompany him on a further walk, this time through the Schloß Berg parkland along the shore of Lake Starnberg. Gudden agreed; the walk may even have been his suggestion, and he told the aides not to join them. His words were ambiguous ("Es darf kein Pfleger mitgehen", "No attendant may come with [us]") and whether they were meant to follow at a discreet distance is not clear. The two men were last seen at about 6:30 pm; they were due back at 8 pm, but never returned. After searches were made for more than two hours by the entire castle staff in a gale with heavy rain, at 10:30 pm that night, the bodies of both the King and von Gudden were found, head and shoulders above the shallow water near the shore. The King's watch had stopped at 6:54. Gendarmes patrolling the park had neither seen nor heard anything unusual. Ludwig's death was officially ruled a suicide by drowning, but the official autopsy report indicated that no water was found in his lungs. Ludwig was a very strong swimmer in his youth, the water was approximately waist deep where his body was found, and he had not expressed suicidal feelings during the crisis. Gudden's body showed blows to the head and neck and signs of strangulation, leading to the suspicion that he was strangled, although no other evidence was found to prove this. Speculation exists that Ludwig was murdered by his enemies while attempting to escape from Berg. One account suggests that the king was shot. The King's personal fisherman, Jakob Lidl (1864–1933), stated, "Three years after the king's death I was made to swear an oath that I would never say certain things – not to my wife, not on my deathbed, and not to any priest … The state has undertaken to look after my family if anything should happen to me in either peacetime or war." Lidl kept his oath, at least orally, but left behind notes that were found after his death. According to Lidl, he had hidden behind bushes with his boat, waiting to meet the king, to row him out into the lake, where loyalists were waiting to help him escape. "As the king stepped up to his boat and put one foot in it, a shot rang out from the bank, apparently killing him on the spot, for the king fell across the bow of the boat." However, the autopsy report indicates no scars or wounds were found on the body of the dead king; on the other hand, many years later, Countess Josephine von Wrba-Kaunitz would show her afternoon tea guests a grey Loden coat with two bullet holes in the back, asserting it was the one Ludwig was wearing. Another theory suggests that Ludwig died of natural causes (such as a heart attack or stroke) brought on by the cool water (12°C) of the lake during an escape attempt. Ludwig's remains were dressed in the regalia of the Order of Saint Hubert, and lay in state in the royal chapel at the Munich Residence Palace. In his right hand, he held a posy of white jasmine picked for him by his cousin the Empress Elisabeth of Austria. After an elaborate funeral on 19 June 1886, Ludwig's remains were interred in the crypt of the Michaelskirche in Munich. His heart, however, does not lie with the rest of his body. Bavarian tradition called for the heart of the king to be placed in a silver urn and sent to the "Gnadenkapelle" (Chapel of Mercy) in Altötting, where it was placed beside those of his father and grandfather. Three years after his death, a small memorial chapel was built overlooking the site and a cross was erected in the lake. A remembrance ceremony is held there each year on 13 June. The King was succeeded by his brother Otto, but since Otto was considered incapacitated by mental illness due to a diagnosis by Dr. Gudden and had been under medical supervision since 1883, the king's uncle Luitpold remained regent. Luitpold maintained the regency until his own death in 1912 at the age of 91. He was succeeded as regent by his eldest son, also named Ludwig. The regency lasted for 13 more months until November 1913, when Regent Ludwig deposed the still-living, but still-institutionalized King Otto, and declared himself King Ludwig III of Bavaria. His reign lasted until the end of the World War I, when monarchy in all of Germany came to an end. Though many considered Ludwig peculiar, the question of clinical insanity remains unresolved. The prominent German brain researcher Heinz Häfner has disagreed with the contention that clear evidence existed for Ludwig's insanity. Others believe he may have suffered from the effects of chloroform used in an effort to control chronic toothache rather than any psychological disorder. His cousin and friend, Empress Elisabeth held that, "The King was not mad; he was just an eccentric living in a world of dreams. They might have treated him more gently, and thus perhaps spared him so terrible an end." One of Ludwig's most quoted sayings was, "I wish to remain an eternal enigma to myself and to others." Today visitors pay tribute to King Ludwig by visiting his grave as well as his castles. Ironically, the very castles which were causing the king's financial ruin have today become extremely profitable tourist attractions for the Bavarian state. The palaces, given to Bavaria by Ludwig III's son Crown Prince Rupprecht in 1923, have paid for themselves many times over and attract millions of tourists from all over the world to Germany each year. Not surprisingly, Ludwig II had a great interest in building. His paternal grandfather, King Ludwig I, had largely rebuilt Munich. It was known as the 'Athens on the Isar'. His father, King Maximilian II, had also continued with more construction in Munich, as well as the construction of Hohenschwangau Castle, the childhood home of Ludwig II, near the future Neuschwanstein Castle of Ludwig II. Ludwig II had planned to build a large opera house on the banks of the Isar River in Munich. This plan was vetoed by the Bavarian government. Using similar plans, a festival theatre was built later in his reign from Ludwig's personal finances at Bayreuth. Ludwig II left behind a large collection of plans and designs for other castles that were never built, as well as plans for further rooms in his completed buildings. Many of these designs are housed today in the King Ludwig II Museum at Herrenchiemsee Castle. These building designs date from the latter part of the King's reign, beginning around 1883. As money was starting to run out, the artists knew that their designs would never be executed. The designs became more extravagant and numerous as the artists realized that there was no need to concern themselves with economy or practicality. It has been said that Richard Wagner's late career is part of Ludwig's legacy, since he almost certainly would have been unable to complete his opera cycle "Der Ring des Nibelungen" or to write his final opera, "Parsifal", without the king's support. Ludwig also sponsored the premieres of "Tristan und Isolde", "Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg", and, through his financial support of the Bayreuth Festival, those of "Der Ring des Nibelungen" and "Parsifal". Ludwig provided Munich with its opera house, Staatstheater am Gärtnerplatz, establishing a lasting tradition of comic and romantic musical theatre known as Singspiele as well as operettas produced for the Bavarian public. The so-called "Swan King" is also said to have inspired the story behind the classical ballet "Swan Lake" by Russian composer Tchaikovsky. This could be referenced to the days of his childhood when he spent much of his youth in a castle named Hohenschwangau ("high region of the swan") in the Bavarian Alps. Ludwig grew up there among swan images and icons, and the nearby Schwansee ("Swan Lake"). A semi-fictionalised version of the history of Ludwig II features strongly in the 1995 computer game "." 

In the United States, National POW/MIA Recognition Day is observed on the third Friday in September. It honors those who were prisoners of war (POWs) and those who are still missing in action (MIA). It is most associated with those who were POWs during the Vietnam War. National Vietnam War Veterans Day is March 29, the date in 1973 when the last US combat troops departed the Republic of Vietnam. This day was established by an Act of Congress, by the passage of Section 1082 of the 1998 Defense Authorization Act. It is one of six days that the POW/MIA Flag can be flown. The POW/MIA flag was first recognized by and made into in 1990. The POW/MIA Flag should fly below, and not be larger than, the United States flag. It is generally flown immediately below or adjacent to the United States flag as second in order of precedence. National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day is different and separate from National POW/MIA Recognition Day. National Former Prisoner of War Recognition Day is April 9th. It was officially designated by Congress in 1988, Public Law 100-269 [Sen J Res 253 100th Congress]. as a Presidentially-proclaimed observance. National Former POW Recognition Day commemorates the April 9, 1942 surrender of approximately 10,000 United States military personnel and 65,000 Filipino soldiers on the Bataan Peninsula in the Philippines by Major General Edward P. King to the invading Imperial Japanese Army headed by General Masaharu Homma. Bataan, thereafter, is distinguished as the largest mass surrender in United States military history. The surrender was followed immediately by the infamous Bataan Death March. By law, the President of the United States must issue annually a proclamation. The Bataan Death March began on April 9, 1942 and lasted, for some, almost two weeks. The Imperial Japanese Army forced all American and Filipino POWs on a 65-mile trek up from Mariveles at the tip of the Bataan Peninsula north to the San Fernando train station. At San Fernando, the men were packed standing in unventilated boxcars for a 24-mile journey by rail to Capas. Survivors then marched an additional three miles to the makeshift POW camp at Camp O’Donnell, an unfinished Philippine Army training facility. It is estimated that at least 10 percent of the men on the March died en route. Sick and starving, the surrendered American and Filipino soldiers on the Bataan Death March were robbed of their personal possessions, denied food, water, and medical care while subject to being beaten, bayoneted, beheaded, crushed by trucks and tanks, and executed. Although this remembrance day is for all who were POWs, it is most associated with those who were POWs of Imperial Japan during WWII. 

Arkley is an area of North London, England, within the London Borough of Barnet (historically Hertfordshire). It is located north northwest of Charing Cross. It consists of a long village strung out between Barnet and Stirling Corner, roughly centred on the "Gate" pub, and composed of the ancient hamlets of Barnet Gate, Rowley Green and Arkley. At above sea level, Arkley is one of the highest points in London. The origins of the name "Arkley" are unclear; it is first recorded as "Arkleyslond" in 1332. The first element of the name appears to come from the Old English word "(e)arc" (or ark, meaning a chest, bin or other wooden receptacle), while the second element is from "leāh", a woodland clearing or glade. "–lond" in the earlier name means "cultivated ground". The name "Arkley" would thus mean "woodland clearing by the ark or by the place where arks are made". It is thought by some that Hendon Wood Lane was originally a minor Roman road. Certainly the name, "Grendel's Gate" (now Barnet Gate, and formerly known as "Grims Gate"), is associated with the monster from the Saxon epic, Beowulf. This implies that the place was of modest importance as early as 1005. It may have been a centre of a small but significant community, founded on a woodland economy. The area is later referred to in medieval documents as "Southhaw", and may have predated the settlement at Chipping Barnet. Certainly, Barnet manorial court was held here in the 13th century. From at least the early 19th century until the 1890s, Arkley was commonly known as "Barnet Common" or "West Barnet". The establishment of the civil parish of 830 acres (3.4 km²) in 1894 confused matters further, as it was defined by the rural area around 'Barnet Town', and included places as far east as Duck Island and Underhill. It is from the civil parish, and the later ward of Barnet Urban District (from 1905) that we have population statistics for Arkley. Between 1901 and 1971, Arkley's population rose from 483 to 16,832. It was transferred from Hertfordshire to Greater London in 1965. St Peter's Church, which was designed by George Beckett, was built in 1840 as a private chapel at a cost of £5,000. It contains a wall tablet of its benefactor, Enoch Durant, who died in 1848. The chancel was added in 1898. After Durant's death the advowson was transferred to the rector of Barnet, and an ecclesiastical parish was formed in 1905. Arkley Windmill was in use by 1806. It is marked as "corn" windmill on the Ordnance Survey of the 1860s. From photographs, it appears to have had only two of its original sails by the 1890s, by which time it may have been powered by steam. It ceased to be a functioning mill during World War I, and was restored in 1930, but not as a working mill. The Gate Inn retains some of its original features. The sign, in the form of a hanging five bar gate, has an inscription which reads:This gate hangs high, According to the old article displayed on one of its walls, the Gate was once visited by Anna Pavlova and her dancing troupe. Until the early 1960s a large tree grew up from the floor of the pub and out through the roof. For its size, Arkley has more Sites of Importance for Nature Conservations than any other district in Barnet: In addition, Dollis Brook and Folly Brook, which are also Sites of Importance for Nature Conservation, rise in Arkley. Nearest: Local clay has been exploited for brick-making and pottery over the centuries. During the 1950s, a 13th-century kiln at Dyke Cottage was excavated, revealing a large cooking pot, and 19th-century Ordnance Survey maps mark a "Tile Works". In the 1970s, John Britten produced a small racing car named the "Arkley" in the area. Arkley Golf Club was founded in 1909. The course was designed by James Braid and Harry Vardon.. On 29 November 1975, a Piper PA-23 Aztec aircraft piloted by retired Formula One racing driver Graham Hill crashed on the golf course, killing all six people on board. 

PARI/GP is a computer algebra system with the main aim of facilitating number theory computations. Versions 2.1.0 and higher are distributed under the GNU General Public License. It runs on most common operating systems. The PARI/GP system is a package that is capable of doing formal computations on recursive types at high speed; it is primarily aimed at number theorists. Its three main strengths are its speed, the possibility of directly using data types that are familiar to mathematicians, and its extensive algebraic number theory module. The PARI/GP system consists of the following standard components: Also available is gp2c, the GP-to-C compiler, which compiles GP scripts into the C language and transparently loads the resulting functions into "gp". The advantage of this is that "gp2c"-compiled scripts will typically run three to four times faster. "gp2c" understands almost all of GP. PARI/GP performs arbitrary precision calculations (e.g., the significand can be millions of digits long—and billions of digits on 64-bit machines). It can compute factorizations, perform elliptic curve computations and perform algebraic number theory calculations. It also allows computations with matrices, polynomials, power series, algebraic numbers and implements many special functions. PARI/GP comes with its own built-in graphical plotting capability. PARI/GP has some symbolic manipulation capability, e.g., multivariate polynomial and rational function handling. It also has some formal integration and differentiation capabilities. PARI/GP can be compiled with GMP (GNU Multiple Precision Arithmetic Library) providing faster computations than PARI/GP's native arbitrary-precision kernel. PARI/GP's progenitor was a program named "Isabelle", an interpreter for higher arithmetic, written in 1979 by Henri Cohen and François Dress at the Université Bordeaux 1. PARI/GP was originally developed in 1985 by a team led by Henri Cohen at Laboratoire A2X and is now maintained by Karim Belabas at the Université Bordeaux 1 with the help of many volunteer contributors. The name PARI is a pun about the project's early stages when the authors started to implement a library for "Pascal ARIthmetic" in the Pascal programming language (although they quickly switched to C), and after ""pari de Pascal"" (Pascal's Wager). The first version of the "gp" calculator was originally called GPC, for Great Programmable Calculator. The trailing C was eventually dropped. Below are some samples of the "gp" calculator usage: 

The Ponce de Leon was a named train of the Southern Railway which ran from Cincinnati, Ohio, to Jacksonville, Florida, from 1924 to the mid-1960s. The "Ponce de Leon" (Train #4) departed Jacksonville at midday going north via subsidiary Georgia Southern and Florida Railroad to Macon and Atlanta, Georgia, then on Southern's former East Tennessee, Virginia and Georgia Railroad line to Chattanooga, Tennessee, traveling overnight to Cincinnati via Southern subsidiary Cincinnati, New Orleans and Texas Pacific Railway. The train provided connections with the New York Central Railroad at Cincinnati for passengers headed to Detroit, Chicago, Cleveland, and Buffalo. The "Royal Palm" alternated with the "Ponce de Leon" on a reverse schedule between Cincinnati and Jacksonville, operating during daylight hours south from Cincinnati and then overnight between Atlanta and Jacksonville. In the latter city there were connections with Florida East Coast Railway for an east coast trip to Miami, and Seaboard Air Line Railroad trains to Miami on an interior route to Tampa. Sleepers were discontinued on the train in November 1959 and it ran as a coach-only consist until the end of operation. In 1964, Southern Railway dropped the Atlanta - Jacksonville leg of the "Ponce's" operation. By the time Southern Railway filed to discontinue the train on January 22, 1968 it was unnamed, operating as Numbers 1 and 2, but only between Cincinnati and Atlanta. The train finally disappeared from the timetable in March 1968. The "Ponce de Leon" and "Royal Palm" collided on December 23, 1926 in Rockmart, Georgia. The northbound "Ponce de Leon" struck the "Royal Palm" with the result that 19 people were killed and 113 were injured, most on the "Ponce de Leon". The accident was also the subject of a song: "The Wreck of the Royal Palm" by Vernon Dalhart. 

The Dobrynin VD-4K was a Soviet six-bank, 24-cylinder, turbo-compound, inline engine developed after the end of World War II. It was superseded by turboprop engines before it could be widely used. The VD-4K, originally designated as the M-253K, was a development of the post-war VD-3TK (M-251K) engine. Like Nazi Germany's experimental Junkers Jumo 222 multibank wartime engine, the VD-4K had six monobloc banks, each with four liquid-cooled cylinders. However, the VD-4K had a larger displacement figure — at nearly 59.5 litres — than any planned or tested development of the German powerplant; itself only planned to have a top displacement figure of 55.5 litres, with a 145 x 140 mm bore-stroke figure for each cylinder in its planned 222C/D version. The VD-4K utilized a trio of blow-down exhaust, also known as power-recovery, turbines were fitted between the cylinder banks, and a geared centrifugal supercharger and a turbocharger were fitted to the engine itself, which made the VD-4K a turbo-compound engine. Development began in January 1949 and construction of the prototype began in September of that year. The first engine was completed in January 1950 and it underwent its 100-hour tests in June. It successfully passed its State acceptance tests in January–February 1951. It was evaluated aboard a Tupolev Tu-4 bomber in 1950, itself powered with a quartet of the Shvetsov OKB's 1946-origin, ASh-73 radial engines, each of a displacement figure of 58.1 litres, somewhat close to that of the Dobrynin multibank powerplant design. The Dobrynin engines were most notably fitted to the two prototypes of the Tupolev Tu-85 bomber, but the aircraft, and its engines, was not placed into production because of the promise offered by turboprop engines of immensely more power, like the Kuznetsov NK-12 — itself developed and in test by 1951 — and used on the Tupolev Tu-95 strategic bomber 

Algaemia refers to the condition where green algae is found in the blood. It has been observed in an immunocompetent patient after removal of a Hickman catheter. In cows, it has been observed to be caused by "Prototheca blaschkeae". In humans, it has been observed to be caused by "Prototheca wickerhamii. 

The Quad Cities MetroLINK, officially the Rock Island County Metropolitan Mass Transit District, provides mass transportation for the Illinois half of the Quad Cities metro area. Both Iowa cities that make up the region have their own systems, but one MetroLINK route does connect with Davenport, Iowa. It is the only transit system in the Quad Cities that operates seven days a week and holidays. The system has a fleet of 60 fixed route buses that is composed of twenty-five 30-foot compressed natural gas buses, eight 40-foot compressed natural gas buses and twenty-two 40-foot diesel buses. As of 2019, they have eight all electric buses. Its annual ridership is 3.5 million. 

Ferdinand Cohen-Blind (March 25, 1844 – May 8, 1866) was a Jewish German student who attempted to assassinate Otto von Bismarck, then the Minister President of Prussia. He committed suicide shortly after his arrest. Cohen-Blind was born in Mannheim, Grand Duchy of Baden to Jacob Abraham Cohen and his second wife Friederike, née Ettlinger. He was the younger brother of Mathilde Blind (1841-1896), who became a well-known poet. Shortly after her son's birth, Friederike began a relationship with journalist and revolutionary Karl Blind, a former student of the University of Heidelberg who had been expelled for expressing radical democratic sentiments. She financially supported Blind's political activities and was arrested with him in the summer of 1847. They married after Jacob Cohen's death in 1848, at which time Ferdinand's last name was changed to Cohen-Blind. After the Baden Revolution Blind and his family went into exile, stopping in Paris and Brussels before arriving in London in 1852. A childhood in exile shaped Ferdinand; following in his parents' shoes, he rejected the monarchical system of the German states, hoping to emulate his stepfather as a champion of democracy. Cohen-Blind returned to Germany in his 18th year, studying at the University of Tübingen and (from 1864) the Agricultural Academy of Hohenheim, where he was known as a good student. After graduating in March 1866, Cohen-Blind went on a hike through Bavaria and Bohemia. The growing likelihood of war between Prussia and Austria led him to the decision to attempt to kill Bismarck, whom he saw as the originator of the threat of civil war. He left Carlsbad, arriving in Berlin and checking into the "Hotel Royal Unter den Linden" hotel on May 5. On the afternoon of May 7, he lay in wait for Bismarck, revolver in hand, in the Unter den Linden, a boulevard in central Berlin. The future Chancellor had just reported to King Wilhelm and was now walking home. When Bismarck was close to the Russian Embassy, Cohen-Blind took aim and fired twice from behind; Bismarck spun around and grabbed his attacker, who was able to fire three more shots before soldiers from the 1st Battalion of the 2nd Guards rushed up and took him into custody. Bismarck continued on his way home. Later that night, he allowed the King's physician, Gustav von Lauer, to examine him. Lauer noted that the first three bullets had only grazed Bismarck's body and the last two had ricocheted off the ribs and had caused no major injuries. Cohen-Blind was taken to police headquarters for questioning, but in an unguarded moment, he slashed his own throat with a knife, severing his carotid artery. He died shortly after 4 a.m. on May 8. His body was quickly buried at night without ceremony in St. Nicholas Cemetery. Cohen-Blind's weapon, a 6-shot Lefaucheux Pepperbox-Revolver in caliber 6mm, is on display in the Bismarck-Museum in Friedrichsruh. 

The Linzer Klangwolke () (Linz Cloud of Sound) is an open-air multimedia musical event held each year since 1979 in early September in the Linz Danube Park in the Austrian town of Linz. It is organized by the Austrian broadcasting company Österreichischer Rundfunk (ORF) and the Brucknerhaus. Admission is free. The Cloud of Sound currently consists of three concerts of modern music, supplemented by visualizations. The series starts with the visualized Cloud of Sound, in which modern music (mostly commissioned works) is staged with lasers, video projections, fireworks, ships, cranes, balloons, etc. This concert attracts an audience of about 100,000. The classic Cloud of Sound is the opening concert of the Brucknerfest, performed without visualization. The children's Cloud of Sound, an afternoon event since 1998, provides musical stories for younger listeners. Dr. Hannes Leopoldseder, director of the ORF’s Upper Austria Regional Studio, was looking for something to connect the Ars Electronica (a festival for art, technology and society) and the Brucknerfest, honoring Austrian composer Anton Bruckner. Discussions with Munich musician and composer Walter Haupt eventually led to the event's creation. On 18 September 1979, 100,000 people listened as a studio pre-recording of Bruckner's Symphony No. 8 in C minor was broadcast through a 20 kilowatt quadrophonic speaker system, opening the Brucknerfest. In 1980, the Bruckner Orchester Linz, under Theodor Guschlbauer, performed Bruckner’s Symphony No. 4 live. Since 1980, the event has been transmitted live from the Brucknerhaus. Currently, speakers with a total power of 250 kilowatts are installed on cranes in front of the Brucknerhaus between the Nibelungen Bridge and a railway bridge. 

The Boundary Bay Brewing Company, also known as the Boundary Bay Brewery & Bistro is a brewery and brewpub in Bellingham, Washington, USA. It was founded in 1995 by Ed Bennett, and has won numerous awards in national and international beer competitions. It is named after Boundary Bay, a bay north of Bellingham that is partially Canadian and partially American territory. During prohibition, rum-runners and bootleggers crossed illegal alcohol into the States through this unique geological feature. The New Brewer, a publication of the Brewers Association, announced in their 2008 annual industry review that the Boundary Bay Brewery & Bistro was the nation's largest brewpub based on number of barrels sold (a brewpub being defined as a restaurant-brewery that sells 25% or more of its beer on site). 

As of the opening of the Guryak Truck Bridge in February 2009 there were three bridges crossing the Konar River. The Konar Provincial Reconstruction Team is working on four additional new bridges. The bridges are designed to last sixty years. According to Lieutenant Neil Myers USN, of the Konar Provincial Reconstruction Team the popularity of the bridges stopped insurgents from attacking the bridges. 

Arsenios Autoreianos (Latinized as Arsenius Autorianus) (), ( 30 September 1273), Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople, lived about the middle of the 13th century. Born in Constantinople c. 1200, Arsenios received his education in Nicaea at a monastery of which he later became the abbot, though not in orders. Subsequently, he gave himself up to a life of solitary asceticism in a Bithynian monastery, and is said to have remained some time in a monastery on Mount Athos. From this seclusion he was called by the Byzantine Emperor Theodore II Lascaris to the position of patriarch at Nicaea in 1255. Upon the emperor's death Arsenios may have shared guardianship of his son John IV Lascaris with George Muzalon: while the later historians Nikephoros Gregoras and Makarios Melissenos say the Patriarch was so named, the contemporary historians Pachymeres and Acropolites name only Mouzalon. Nevertheless, a few days after Theodore's death George Muzalon was murdered by Michael Palaiologos, and who, at an assembly of the aristocracy presided over by Patriarch Arsenios, was appointed regent for the boy. Arsenios also performed the double coronation of Michael Palaiologos and John Lascaris in January 1259. Through the time between the death of Mouzalon and the double coronation, Arsenios had worked to protect the rights of the young emperor John Lascaris, at one point insisting that John and Michael exchange mutual oaths of loyalty. He also insisted that at the double coronation John Lascaris should be crowned first, which Michael Palaiologos saw as a serious barrier to his final usurpation. Pressure was put upon the patriarch to allow Palaiologos to be crowned alone, and even the young emperor was threatened. The patriarch found no support from the bishops assembled: except for two prelates, all believed that Palaiologos had the right to be crowned first. Arsenios at last conceded the point and crowned Michael and his wife first, while John Lascaris received only a special head-dress. The ceremony completed, Arsenios took refuge in the monastery of Paschasius, retaining his office of patriarch but refusing to discharge its duties. Nicephorus of Ephesus was appointed in his stead. Michael Palaiologos, having recovered Constantinople from the Latin Empire, induced Arsenios to undertake the office of patriarch, but soon incurred Arsenios' severe censure by ordering the young prince John to be blinded. Arsenios went so far as to excommunicate Emperor Michael Palaiologos; after attempting to frighten the patriarch into rescinding the excommunication by threatening to appeal to the Pope, Michael at last convened a synod, had Arsenios deposed, and towards the end of May 1265 sent him into exile. There he died some years afterwards (according to Fabricius in 1264; others say in 1273). Throughout these years Arsenios declined to lift the sentence of excommunication from Michael and after his death, when the new patriarch Joseph gave absolution to the emperor, the dispute was carried on between the "Arsenites" and the "Josephists." The "Arsenian schism" lasted till 1315, when a reconciliation was pronounced by the patriarch Nephon I. Arsenius is said to have prepared the decisions of the councils and the works of the Fathers a summary of divine laws under the title "Synopsis Canonum". Some hold that "Synopsis" was the work of another Arsenios, a monk of Athos; the ascription depends on whether the patriarch Arsenios did or did not reside at Mount Athos.

The Canterbury University Tramping Club (CUTC) is a sport club at the University of Canterbury, in Christchurch, New Zealand. It was formed for the pursuit of outdoor activities, mainly tramping, mountaineering and climbing. Members also go mountain biking, kayaking and skiing. Most members are students, staff or recent graduates of the University of Canterbury. The club has weekly meetings during term time, and multiple trips going away most weekends. The club dates back to before 1934, first being known as the 'Canterbury College Tramping Club', then later 'Canterbury University College Tramping Club' and finally 'Canterbury University Tramping Club'. Around 1967 the related University of Canterbury Canoe Club was formed by members of the tramping club. The Avoca Hut, situated in the Craigieburn Forest Park, is a 6-bunk 'raised A-frame' design hut, built in 1947. The Canterbury University Tramping Club is still responsible for its maintenance, with a committee role specifically for the hut. In the mid 1950s the club took over Steeds Hut, situated in Arthur's Pass Village. Its location is noted on a map inside the local train station. The hut was sold in the 1990s after failing multiple building WOFs. TWALK (from "twenty-four hour walk") is an annual rogaining event run by the club. It is the largest event organised by the club, with participants travelling from across New Zealand to compete. The event has been run every year since 1967. The purpose of creating the event was stated in the original report by organizer Greg Martin: A movie titled '50 Years of TWALK' was created to celebrate the history of the unique event, which premiered in 2017. TROG (trips-log) is a book published by the CUTC covering events of the year. Although described as an annual it often has large lapses between publications. It was last published in 2014. The club used to distribute newsletters on a quarterly basis. The University of Canterbury Library has an archive of tramping club publications dating back to the 1940s. 

The Pelican was a named train of the Southern Railway which ran from New York City to New Orleans and back until 1970.

From Bristol to New Orleans, the "Pelican" ran on Southern's line with major station stops in Knoxville, Tennessee, Chattanooga, Tennessee, Birmingham, Alabama and Meridian, Mississippi. South of Birmingham it made more local stops than other Southern Railway trains on the Birmingham-New Orleans route, such as the "Southerner." Train Number 42, the northbound "The Pelican" reversed the route. In 1957, "The Pelican" carried: Into the 1950s, the train carried through sleeping cars which would split from the main route at Meridian and continue on the Illinois Central Railroad's "Southwestern Limited" into central Mississippi and central Louisiana to Shreveport, Louisiana. Timetables referred to section, compartment and drawing room accommodations carrying from New York to Shreveport With passenger traffic declining, the "Pelican" was combined with the "Birmingham Special" in 1970.

The Lakvijaya Power Station () (also known as the Norochcholai Power Station (; ), after its location) is the largest power station in Sri Lanka. The power station is in Norocholai, Puttalam, on the southern end of the Kalpitiya Peninsula. Construction of the facility began on , with the first unit commissioning on . The first phase was completed and ceremonially commissioned by President Mahinda Rajapaksa on , with the presence of Minister of Energy Champika Ranawaka, deputy Minister of Energy Premalal Jayasekara. According to the Ceylon Electricity Board, the generates nearly of electricity annually — a significant amount when compared to Sri Lanka's total production of in 2011. The plant is connected to the grid via 220-kilovolt transmission line to Veyangoda. Power station exhausts are emitted through a tall chimney, one of the country's tallest man-made structures. During its pre-development stages, protests were launched by residents living at the project site, claiming that they were deceived by the government. Since its creation the power plant has faced several breakdowns. It has been alleged by the Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister, Ajith P. Perera, that the power plant was built with substandard and outdated material and is below international standards, and that the government is unable to claim any damages as the Rajapaksa government agreed to use the materials specified in the agreement which are sub-standard. In the plant, the electricity is produced using a steam turbine which is capable of producing 300MW. Coal is used as the fuel to produce steam that will then be used to rotate the turbine at a speed of 3000 rpm. Coal is imported from Indonesia since it is cheap and good quality. The coal in India is cheaper as compared with Indonesia, but Indonesian coal is used since the Indian coal contains more sulfur. Despite this, the vessels that carry coal come from a Russian port. At first the coal is brought from Indonesia via ships (65 tons per ship). The ships are anchored around 5 km from shore. This coal is brought in to the plant by using barges (long flat-bottomed boats) and then by conveyors. The coal should be maintained around 10% moisture content immediately before it is used. It needs to be ground as powder before it is burnt. There are five "mills" that pulverize (grind) the coal. Four ball mills work at a time while another one is in standby.

Major Howard Redmayne Harker (12 May 1891 – 27 February 1919) was a British World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories. Howard Harker was born in Prestwich, Lancashire, the son of the architect John Dent Harker (1860–1933). He attended the Lawrence House School in St. Annes-on-Sea, and the Rossall School in Fleetwood, before graduating from Manchester University. From 1913 he was employed at the Royal Aircraft Factory at Farnborough, Hampshire. In February 1915 he made a memorable arrival at Hendon Aerodrome in a new B.E.2c biplane flown by Frank Goodden, who treated the assembled crowd to an impromptu display of aerial acrobatics before landing. Harker was commissioned in the Royal Flying Corps as a temporary second lieutenant (on probation) on 15 April 1916.

He died from pneumonia on 27 February 1919 at the Officers' Military Hospital at Tidworth, and is buried in the Southern Cemetery, Manchester. 

Captain Peter Pégus was one of the first European settlers of the Swan River Colony in Western Australia. Peter was born to Peter Pégus (senior) in 1786, a wealthy cotton-plantation owner in Grenada, after whom Pégus Point on the southern tip of Carriacou is named. In 1806, he served as a Lieutenant with the Royal Tyrone Militia in Ireland. The following year, he transferred to the Connaught Rangers regiment, where he fought against Napoleon in the Peninsular War. Peter retired from the army in 1828, and applied for land grants in Western Australia, not on the basis of military service, but instead, on the basis of the property he would bring to Australia. Peter's application was successful, and he arrived at the Swan River on 19 October 1829 aboard the Atwick, with his wife Mary Jane, his younger son William, 2 sheep, 5 servants, and £1,552. He was allowed to select of land, which he did in the area known today as Thornlie. This area was named "Coleraine". However, in 1834, Coleraine was largely destroyed in a bushfire, which ended the settlement. Peter, who had lost much of his wealth, then left for Van Diemen's land per "Elizabeth" (a ship also carrying convicts) in March 1836. Following the death of his first wife in 1839, Peter married Mary Sophia Skardon in Launceston in 1840. Peter had two sons, Campbell John Pégus, born 1814 in Britain, and William Jeffries Pégus, born 1820 in Glasgow.

Fritz Cronman (c. 1640 - c. 1680) was a Major for the Swedish Empire in the late 17th century, and the Swedish diplomat to the Tsardom of Russia from 1668 to 1669. His extant diary and letters contain detailed information on the court of Ivan V of Russia. He was born in Swedish Livonia to Hans Detterman Croman. He participated in the border commission with Russia in Keksholm, but the negotiations ended when the Russian commissioners walked out on the talks. On 26 September 1668 he was appointed as the Swedish diplomat to the Tsardom of Russia under Ivan V of Russia. On 8 October 1668 he sailed to Finland and then traveled overland to Narva. On 10 November 1668 he arrived at the Russian border at Orlina, where he was escorted to Novgorod. In his letter from Novgorod to the Swedish government he writes: "Russians inevitably must be impelled to such unusual "höflighetsbetygelser" either under pressure from the enemy side or from fear of his friends." He arrived in Moscow on 28 December 1668. His Swedish entourage consisted of 35 people. While in Russia, he made a copy of the Godunov map, one of two extant copies, the original by Petr Ivanovich Godunov having not survived. He married Christina Ottiliana Börner and had a daughter, Charlotta Cronman, who married Henrik Gotthard von Buddenbrock (1648-1727). Charlotta and Henrick had as their son, Henrik Magnus Buddenbrock. 

The Blue Mansion is a 2009 film directed by Glen Goei. The film had its world premiere at the 14th Pusan International Film Festival and was released in Singaporean theatres in an edited NC16 version at the request of the distributor on 22 October 2009. The uncut version was classified M18 by the Media Development Authority. The film was the opening film of the Berlin Asian Hot Shots Film Festival 2010 and was in competition at the Tokyo International Film Festival 2009 and the Shanghai International Film Festival 2010. It debuted in Kuala Lumpur on 18 March 2010 and was shown in Penang during the George Town Festival 2010. "The Blue Mansion" is a quirky murder mystery about a wealthy Asian tycoon who dies suddenly under mysterious circumstances and returns as a ghost to try to uncover the secret of his death. Two eager detectives investigate the death, chasing all leads and suspects, including the dead man's three children. The ghost witnesses his own funeral wake, attended by jealous relatives and business competitors as well as the police investigation that unveils hidden family secrets. Director Glen Goei sold his home in London to raise the film's S$2.8 million budget, which Goei exceeded. The movie was filmed entirely on location in Penang at the Cheong Fatt Tze Mansion, a UNESCO Architectural Heritage Award recipient, over 6 weeks in 2008. Goei was hoping to shoot in Singapore but couldn't find a grand mansion that hadn't been demolished. To hire production designer Ian Bailey, whose work on "Atonement" and "Pride & Prejudice" Goei had admired, Goei bought a film directory from the British Film Institute and called him. He also called 10 cinematographers simultaneously, and director of photography Larry Smith was the first to respond. "The Blue Mansion" was originally called "The Funeral Party". Its screenplay took three years to write and the film more than a decade to produce. "The Blue Mansion" was fairly well received by critics. Derek Elley of "Variety" praised director Glen Goei for keeping the film "nicely balanced between comedy and drama" and making "cinematic use of his single location". However, he blamed Ken Kwek's "gauche" script, with its "weak third act and dialogue more suited to the stage than the screen", for letting down Goei's evident "ambition to make quality commercial fare". "The Jakarta Post" called "The Blue Mansion" "one of Singapore's most stylish movies" and noted its "new perspective on the Singaporean world of cinema" and "splendid cast". "The Urban Wire" praised "the director’s attention to detail" and the film's "intriguing mystery", "well-developed characters", "solid acting", "cleverly crafted humour", "fabulous cinematography" and "brilliant music", but found its ending confusing. Lisa-Ann Lee of "SG" magazine awarded it 2.5/5, praising it as "a valiant effort" and "a very polished production" even if "you get the feeling that you’ve seen it all before" and "it makes that sharp turn toward melodrama and the bizarre near the end". Nevertheless, she called for audiences to give it a chance as "Goei has taken a huge gamble by directing the most articulate and literate local film to date". Genevieve Loh of "TODAY" gave the film 3/5, comparing this "ambitious and slick second talkie" to Robert Altman's "Gosford Park". She praised the "cleverly lit and beautifully framed" film's "storyline [for] hitting bravely close to home" even if there are times when the film "feels overwrought with the mixing of one-too-many genres". Academic Kenneth Paul Tan analysed "The Blue Mansion" in the NETPAC journal "Cinemas of Asia", arguing that "the film points to the larger tragedy of authoritarian cultures of conformity and dependency" and "shows the folly and danger of chauvinistic attitudes that fester within society". Tan also noted how "identifying the parallels between the family/corporate world in the film and the family/political world in Singapore is, in fact, one of the film's many pleasures". Fridae called it "easily the must-watch of the week" and noted how online commentators had drawn "parallels between Wee Bak Chuan and Singapore’s founding father Lee Kuan Yew", adding that "there’s no denying how powerfully layered a satire it becomes because of them". "The Blue Mansion" earned a respectable S$70,465 in its opening weekend on 12 prints in Singapore and ultimately earned US$146,800 after five weeks. The film failed to garner international distribution, which Goei blames for causing him to lose all the money he had made on "Forever Fever". 

George Barry Purdy (20 February 1944 – 30 December 2017) was a mathematician and computer scientist who specialized in cryptography, combinatorial geometry and number theory. Purdy received his Ph.D. from the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign in 1972, officially under the supervision of Paul T. Bateman, but his de facto adviser was Paul Erdős. He was on the faculty in the mathematics department at Texas A&M University for 11 years, and was appointed the Geier Professor of computer science at the University of Cincinnati in 1986. Purdy had Erdős number one and coauthored many papers with Paul Erdős, who regarded him as his own student. He is the "P" in G.W. Peck, a pseudonym for the group of mathematicians that also included Ronald Graham, Douglas West, Paul Erdős, Fan Chung, and Daniel Kleitman. In 1971, Purdy was asked by Larry Roberts, the director of the DARPA Information Processing Techniques Office, to develop a secure hash function to protect passwords on ARPANET. Purdy developed the so-called Purdy polynomial, which was a polynomial of degree 2 + 17 computed modulo the 64-bit prime "p" = 2 - 59. The terms of the polynomial could be computed using modular exponentiation. DARPA was satisfied with the hash function, and also allowed Purdy to publish it in Communications of the ACM. It was well received around the world, and DEC eventually used it in their OpenVMS operating system. A DEC report said they chose it because it was very secure and because the existing standard DES could not be exported, which meant that an alternative was needed. OpenVMS uses a 64-bit version, based on a 64-bit prime, the same size as the one in the paper. While at Texas A&M, Purdy made an empirical observation about distances between points on two lines. Suppose that "n" points are to be chosen on line "L" and another "n" points on line "M". If "L" and "M" are perpendicular or parallel, then the points can be chosen so that the number of distinct distances determined is bounded by a constant multiply of "n", but otherwise the number is much larger. Erdős was very struck by this conjecture and told it to many others, and it was published in a book of unsolved problems by William Moser in 1981. It came to the attention of György Elekes, who eventually proved the conjecture as the first application of new tools from algebraic geometry that he was developing. After Elekes's untimely death, Micha Sharir collected Elekes's notes and published an organized presentation of these algebraic methods, including work of his own. This, in turn, enabled Katz and Guth to solve the Erdős distinct distances problem, a 1946 problem of Erdős. Work continues on improvements in Purdy's conjecture. In 2015, Purdy was awarded the IEEE Joseph Desch Award for Innovation for his work on the Arpa Network and the Purdy Polynomial. 

Squadron Leader William Harrop was a British World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories while flying as an enlisted observer. He returned to RAF service in World War II, attaining the rank of squadron leader. Harrop was awarded his Military Medal on 14 December 1916, while serving as a pioneer in the Royal Engineers. Sergeant Harrop served as an observer/gunner aboard the Airco DH.9s of 104 Squadron, teamed with Lt. George Smith. He drove down a Pfalz D.III over Boulay Airfield on 1 August 1918 for his first victory. On a morning patrol on the 12th, Harrop and Smith destroyed another Pfalz D.III, aided Arthur Rullion Rattray and his pilot in destroying an Albatros D.V, and drove down a third German fighter out of control over Saverne. One of these victories was over Vfw. Heinrich Krueger of "Jasta 70". Three days later, at 1830 hours, Harrop and Smith drove another Pfalz down out of control, to make both men aces. Both were taken prisoner on 22 August 1918 after a raid on Mannheim. Harrop's final score was 1 (& 1 shared) destroyed, 2 (& 1 shared) 'out of control'. Harrop was promoted from warrant officer to flying officer on 29 April 1940, and confirmed in his rank a year later, on 29 April 1941. On 1 March 1942, he was promoted to temporary flight lieutenant. Harrop became a squadron leader on 1 January 1946. On 1 November 1947, Harrop was reverted to the rank of flight lieutenant, with a seniority date from 1 September 1945. He retired from the RAF on 24 June 1948, and was allowed to retain the rank of squadron leader. 

The people of Eddaland, known as the Eddics, are often mistaken to be a sub-group of the Igbo people in south-eastern Nigeria. The land and people of Eddaland have been constitutionally designated the present day Afikpo South Local Government Area of Ebonyi State, Nigeria. In effect Eddish people are forced to identify very differently from their true heritage as Eddics. Outside Africa, Edda is considered mythical, and relates to ancient Nordic Vikings folklores. While there is today no very detailed anthropological linkage of Edda in today’s Nigeria Ebonyi to Nordic Europe, Eddish people there have very striking pagan religious practices that mirror ancient Viking culture. These traditions have been dying out since colonial times due to colonialist introduction of Christianity and wider integration of Eddics into the local culture of the more dominant Igbo ethnic group. Prominent Philanthropist and Merchants of the Edda Kingdom includes HIGH CHIEF AGAMA NNACHI, ETC 

Tecovirimat (ST-246 or Tpoxx) is an antiviral with activity against orthopoxviruses such as smallpox and monkeypox. It is the only antipoxviral drug approved in the United States. The drug works by blocking cellular transmission of the virus, thus preventing the disease. Tecovirimat has been effective in laboratory testing; it has been shown to protect animals from monkeypox and rabbitpox and causes no serious side effects in humans. However, tecovirimat has never been used to treat a human with smallpox due to the disease's eradication. Two million doses of tecovirimat are stockpiled in the US Strategic National Stockpile should an orthopoxvirus-based bioterror attack occur. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) considers it to be a first-in-class medication. The results of clinical trials involving tecovirimat supports its use against smallpox and other related orthopoxviruses. It has shown potential for a variety of uses including preventive healthcare, as a post-exposure therapeutic, as a therapeutic and an adjunct to vaccination. Tecovirimat can be taken orally and has recently been granted permission to conduct Phase II trials by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). In Phase I trials tecovirimat was generally well tolerated with no serious adverse events. Due to its importance for biodefense, the FDA has designated tecovirimat for 'fast-track' status, creating a path for expedited FDA review and eventual regulatory approval. On 13 July 2018, the FDA announced approval of tecovirimat. Tecovirimat inhibits the function of a major envelope protein required for the production of extracellar virus. Thus the virus is prevented from leaving an infected cell and the spread of the virus within the body is prevented. Originally researched by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, the drug was previously owned by Viropharma and discovered in collaboration with scientists at USAMRIID. It is currently owned and manufactured by Siga Technologies, a pharmaceutical company in the biodefense arena that won a government contract to develop the drug.

Sous Lieutenant Marius René Marie Hasdenteufel (1894–1918) was a French World War I flying ace credited with five confirmed and two probable aerial victories. See also Aerial victory standards of World War I<br> Marius René Marie Hasdenteufel was born on 15 October 1894 in Sierck-les-Bains, German Lorraine, in present day Lorraine, France. On 22 July 1915, he volunteered to serve in the French military for the duration of the World War. He was immediately posted to aviation duty. On 31 December 1915, he received Military Pilots Brevet No. 2223. In April 1916, he began artillery spotting duties in a reconnaissance squadron. He was mentioned in dispatches twice. In November 1916, he was promoted to Adjutant. He was then sent for advanced training on fighter planes. After that, on 15 March 1917, he was stationed with "Escadrille 57". On the day of his first aerial victory, 24 October 1917, he was severely wounded. He was ambulanced off to hospital on 9 November 1917. He returned to duty on 16 January 1918. Between 12 March and 25 June 1918, teaming with other French pilots, he would score four more victories. In the midst of this skein of wins, he was promoted temporarily to the rank of "Sous lieutenant". He died in an aerial accident on 26 June 1918, while piloting a SPAD S.VII biplane fighter aircraft in Champagne, in unknown circumstances. During his service, he had been awarded the "Médaille militaire", the"Croix de Guerre", and the Belgian Order of the Crown.

"Maréchal-des-logis" Marcel Hauss was a French World War I flying ace credited with five aerial victories. See also Aerial victory standards of World War I<br> Marcel Hauss was born in Paris on 31 July 1890. He began his military service as a Cuirassier, but transferred to aviation in September 1915. He graduated from pilot training in mid-1916. On 10 December 1916, he was posted to "Escadrille N.57". Between 27 December 1916 and 29 January 1917, he was confirmed to have helped shoot down five German airplanes, with a sixth victory going uncredited. On 15 February 1917, he was shot down and killed while attacking a German two-seated reconnaissance aircraft above Saint-Mihiel. 

Haroutiun Galentz (also Kalents, ; March 27, 1910 in Kyurin - March 7, 1967 in Yerevan), was a prolific Armenian painter. Galentz was born in Gürün, Ottoman Empire (present day Turkey) on March 27 of 1910. His father Tiratur owned a wool-dying factory which left a profound impression on young Galentz with its vats of bright colors. In 1915, during the Armenian genocide, Galentz’ father was taken away by Turkish soldiers, never to be seen again. Galentz along with his three brothers and mother escaped to Aleppo, Syria. A few days after their arduous trek into Aleppo, Galentz’ mother died of starvation and fatigue. Galentz and his three brothers spent their childhood and youth in an Aleppo orphanage. Despite the hardships of life in the orphanage, Galentz began cultivating his passion for arts in part by encouragement from one of the orphanage sisters. He often escaped the orphanage to roam around the Aleppo markets and paint. French art historians called him "The man who had no childhood". In 1922, at the age of 12, Galentz left the orphanage to become an apprentice to a lithographer and later received his primary artistic education from Onik Avetisyan in Aleppo. He then followed his brothers to Tripoli, Lebanon where they had opened a photo studio. Galentz painted backgrounds to be used in the photo sessions. From 1929-1933, French painter Claude Michulet was his teacher in Beirut Academy of Fine Arts, where he then taught painting until 1939. Galentz was awarded the Medal of Merit by the presidium of International Exhibitions in New York in 1939, and the honorary prize by the government of Lebanon for his bas-reliefs in the Pavilion of Lebanon presented at the New York International exhibition. In 1938 he took into apprenticeship a young woman by the name of Armine Paronyan (Galentz), whom he later married on May 2, 1943. Armine became a prominent Armenian painter alongside her husband. They had two sons, Armen and Saro (1946-2017), who is a painter too. Galentz and family expatriated to Yerevan, Armenia in June 1946. The next year he participated in a group show organized to exhibit the works of newly expatriated painters. He participated in group exhibitions organized by the Artists Union, of which he was a member since 1947. He held several solo shows both in Yerevan and in Moscow and was posthumously awarded Armenian Republic’s (SSR) State Prize in 1967. His landscapes and still lifes are imbued with light. According to Henrik Igityan, "looking at the radiant, cheerful paintings of Galents, remembering his kind uistful eyes, one finds it impossible to realize that this quiet sad man is the author of those bright optimistic poetic tales". Alexander Gitovich dedicated one of his poems to Galentz. Galentz is one of the heroes of "People without childhood" by Antranig Dzarugian. Galentz’ house in Yerevan is now a museum. His paintings are also in the collections of the National Gallery of Armenia (Yerevan), the Modern Art Museum of Yerevan, the Ministry of Culture in Armenia as well as in some private collections in Moscow, Saint Petersburg, Tbilisi, New York, Paris, Vienna, Beirut, Aleppo, Cambridge, San Francisco, Los Angeles, to list a few. On April 27, 2010 Haroutiun and Armine Galentz Museum was opened in 18 Galents St., Yerevan. There are 200 canvases and more than 200 graphical works in the museum, including archive materials. The museum has two floors. Harutyun Galents’s works are displayed on the first floor. 

Let's Go Native is a 1930 American pre-Code black-and-white musical comedy film, directed by Leo McCarey and released by Paramount Pictures. Jerry comments on being the only man on an island populated by women, "It was one of the Virgin Islands, but it drifted." The tagline was: "Paramount's wild, merry, mad hilarious farce!" 

The officer in charge (OIC) is the gazetted officer in command of a police station in Sri Lanka. He/she is in charge of most of the investigations of the station and for maintenance of law and order within that police area. Officer in charge can also refer to the head officer of a fire station or district, as well as other public safety agencies, such as forestry districts and EMS districts. In the Canadian navy, the senior officer on board an orca-class patrol vessel is the officer in charge. However, they are usually referred to as "captain". 

Albertdina is a smock mill in Noord-Sleen, Drenthe, the Netherlands. It was built in 1906 and is listed as a Rijksmonument, number 33783. The windmill "Concordia" stood on this site from 1904 until it was burnt down in 1906. It had originally been built in Damsterdiep, Groningen in 1771 and moved to Noord-Sleen in 1904 To replace it, the 1851-built corn mill "Molen van Grashuis" was moved from Usquert, Groningen, to Noord-Sleen by millwright H Wiertsma of Scheemda, Groningen. The first miller was Mr Westerling. Nine windmills that he worked burnt down. Westerling took a mill at 't Haantje in 1909 and "Albertdina" was bought by J Ziengs. The mill was restored in 1953 by millwright Christiaan Bremer of Adorp, Groningen. Since 1976 the mill has been owned by the local council. During the 1970s, the mill had a pair of Patent sails and a pair of Common sails, but it now has four Common sails. The sails have been shortened due to a nearby building. "Albertdina" is what the Dutch describe as an "achtkante grondzeiler". It is a three-storey smock mill on a single-storey brick base. There is no stage, the sails reaching almost to the ground. The smock and cap are thatched. The mill is winded by a tailpole and winch. The four Common sails have a span of are carried in a cast-iron "windshaft", which was cast by Prins van Oranje, Den Haag in 1906. The "windshaft" also carries the "brake wheel", which has 65 cogs. The "brake wheel" drives the "wallower" (35 cogs) at the top of the "upright shaft". At the bottom of the "upright shaft" the "great spur wheel", which has 102 cogs, drives the diameter French Burr millstones via "lantern pinion stone nut" which has 27 staves. Reference for above:- "Albertdina" is open by appointment, or when a blue flag is flying. It is open on the Dutch National Mills Day and Open Monument Day. 

First Congregational Church is a church of the United Church of Christ located in downtown Long Beach, California. The church occupies a historic red brick structure that was built in 1914. The Italian Romanesque Revival building has been designated as a Long Beach Historic Landmark and was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2012. The church was founded in 1888. The current church building, designed in the Italian Romanesque style, was completed in 1914 at a total cost of $210,000. Joachim Bixby, Sr., known as the "Father of Long Beach," was the largest contributor to the construction fund, having given $25,000. The building was designed in the Romanesque style by architect H.M. Patterson of Los Angeles and built of red pressed brick laid in patterns and trimmed with white terra cotta. The large auditorium had the capacity for seating 1,500 persons. The Los Angeles Times wrote that the "immense auditorium, the roof of which is fifty-five feet above the floor, gives one the impression he is entering one of the cathedrals of Europe." The Times also referred to the church's art-glass windows as being "among the finest to be seen in the West." The church also featured three great rose windows above the gallery and six picture windows below the gallery. The center window was called the "Light of the World." The church building was dedicated in December 1914 with more than 2,000 Congregationalists in attendance. The Los Angeles Times described the church as "magnificent" and reported that its "architecture and appointments are without peer in Southern California." It was the largest church in Southern California when it opened. In 1924, a three-story education building with an auditorium was added to the campus. By 1927, the congregation had grown to become the fifth largest Congregational church in the United States with 1,700 members. The church sustained extensive damage in the 1933 Long Beach earthquake and was closed for several months while repairs were made. Rev. Henry Kendall Booth was the pastor at the church from 1909 until his death in 1942. The church appeared in the 2007 movie "License to Wed". The church practices a liberal theology and has a long history of social activism, including programs to assist the poor, homeless and disabled. In 1992, the church publicly declared that it welcomed gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender persons into membership, employment and leadership. By 2005, 42% of the church members were from the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community. In 2007, the church gained media attention when the senior pastor, Jerald Stinson, vowed to defy an order that he block homeless people from sleeping on the steps and grounds of the church. At the time, Stinson said, "The city's threats are ludicrous. We're not going to do what they want us to do. Allowing these people to sleep on our property is, for us, a religious act."

The National Lottery () is the state lottery of Republic of Ireland. It was created when the Republic of Ireland government passed the National Lottery Act, 1986 to help raise funds for good causes. The eligible causes are sport and recreation, health and welfare, national heritage and the arts, the Irish language, and the natural environment. National Lottery gaming operations began on 23 March 1987 with scratchcards, and the flagship drawing game, Lotto, began in March 1988. The National Lottery now operates three families of drawing games (Lotto, EuroMillions, and Daily Million), funds televised bingo and game shows, sells a wide range of scratchcards, and runs a number of Millionaire Raffles each year. National Lottery games are available online as well as through a network of over 3,700 retail agents nationwide. By the end of 2013, the National Lottery had achieved over €12 billion in cumulative sales, had paid out €6.7 billion in prizes, and had raised €4.4 billion for the good causes it supports. In 2011, 2.2 million Irish people (64 percent of the adult population) reported playing National Lottery games, with 1.5 million (42 percent) reporting that they played weekly. In 2013, due to a financial crisis that had left the Irish state running a large budget deficit, the Irish government agreed to sell the National Lottery licence for 20 years to a private operator, Premier Lotteries Ireland. The new operator took ownership of the licence on 27 February 2014. The government is receiving €405 million from the sale, some of which will finance the construction of a new National Children's Hospital. From its inception until 27 February 2014, the National Lottery was operated under licence by the An Post National Lottery Company (), which was 80 percent owned by Ireland's state-owned postal services provider An Post and 20 percent by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. In 2011, in response to Ireland's financial crisis, the government included the National Lottery licence on a list of state assets that could be sold to assist the public finances. In April 2012, the government announced that it would sell the National Lottery licence for a period of 20 years for an upfront payment, while ensuring that 30 percent of lottery sales would still go to fund its designated good causes. The licence was valued at between €200 and €600 million, with some estimates putting its value in the region of €500 million. In May 2013, the Irish government enacted the National Lottery Act 2013 to allow for the sale of the National Lottery licence, provide for the establishment of a new independent lottery regulator, and eliminate some restrictions on Internet gambling to allow for the growth of online lottery sales. The legislation also added the natural environment to the list of good causes eligible to receive lottery funding. On 3 October 2013, Minister Howlin announced that the government had agreed to sell the National Lottery licence for €405 million to Premier Lotteries Ireland, a consortium comprising An Post, An Post pension funds, and the Ontario Teachers' Pension Plan (owner of the Camelot Group, operators of the UK National Lottery). Dermot Griffin, head of the An Post National Lottery Company since 2006, became chief executive of Premier Lotteries Ireland and remained in that post until 2019, having been replaced by Andrew Algeo. Other existing senior management were also retained. Executives from the Camelot Group, the Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan, and An Post were appointed to the board of the new company. The process of finalizing the lottery contracts was delayed due to an industrial dispute involving the employees of An Post National Lottery Company over the terms and conditions of staff transfers to Premier Lotteries Ireland, but the dispute was resolved in February 2014, and contracts were signed on 27 February 2014. Some of the funds paid to the Irish state will be used for a range of local infrastructural projects, including the construction of a National Children's Hospital. The National Lottery began gaming operations on 23 March 1987, when it launched its first scratchcards. Since then, the National Lottery has expanded its product line to include the Lotto family of games, television bingo, televised game shows, regular "Millionaire Raffles," participation in the transnational EuroMillions lottery, and a daily €1 million game called Daily Million. National Lottery tickets and scratchcards are sold by a network of over 3,700 agents around the country. In March 2009, the National Lottery began offering online sales of instant-win games, as well as key draw games such as Lotto and EuroMillions. Internet sales increased by 43 percent in 2012, to €8.7 million, with around 40,000 players registered to play games online. In 2012, total National Lottery sales were €734 million. A total of €406 million was distributed in prizes and €225 million was distributed to good causes. All cash prizes won in National Lottery games are paid as tax-free lump sums. All prizes in Lotto, EuroMillions, and Daily Million games must be claimed within 90 days of the applicable drawing dates. No minor under the age of 18 may purchase tickets for or claim prizes in any National Lottery game. Winners have the right to remain anonymous. Lotto, which began in March 1988, is the National Lottery's flagship drawing game. It is currently a 6/47 lottery with an additional "bonus ball." Its starting jackpot is a guaranteed €2 million, which rolls over until it is won. The minimum play in Lotto has always been two lines of six numbers each. At Lotto's current cost of €2 per line, a Lotto ticket costs a minimum of €4. Lotto has produced two spinoff games, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1, which began in 1997, and Lotto Plus, which began in 2000. The largest ever Lotto jackpot of €18.9 million was won on 28 June 2008 by a syndicate of 16 colleagues at a quarry and concrete plant in Bennekerry, Carlow. Sales of Lotto fell from €379.1 million in 2011 to €339.7 million in 2012. The National Lottery said that this reflected lower jackpot levels during the year. The first Lotto drawing was held on Saturday, 16 April 1988. In its original 6/36 format, six numbered balls were drawn from a lottery machine containing 36 balls. Players could win a share of a guaranteed £250,000 jackpot by matching all six numbers, or win smaller prizes by matching four or five numbers. If no winning ticket was sold, the jackpot rolled over for the next draw. Drawings continued each Saturday night until 30 May 1990, when the National Lottery introduced a midweek Lotto draw on Wednesday nights. Lotto draws have been held twice weekly since that time. The Lotto for Saturday if Christmas Day is falling on Saturday transferred to Christmas Eve, Friday or Wednesday draw to Tuesday (1991-2002) or Thursday in 2013. In a 6/36 lottery, the odds of matching all six numbers and winning the jackpot are 1 in 1,947,792. At Lotto's initial cost of £0.50 per line, all possible combinations could be purchased for £973,896. This left Lotto vulnerable to a brute force attack, which happened when the jackpot reached £1.7 million for the May 1992 bank holiday drawing. A 28-member Dublin-based syndicate, organized and headed by Polish-Irish businessman Stefan Klincewicz, had spent six months preparing by marking combinations on almost a quarter of a million paper playslips. In the days before the drawing they tried to buy up all possible combinations and thus win all possible prizes, including the jackpot. The National Lottery tried to foil Klincewicz's plan by limiting the number of tickets any single machine could sell, and by turning off the terminals his ticket purchasers were known to be using heavily. Despite its efforts, the syndicate did manage to buy over 80 percent of the combinations, spending an estimated £820,000 on tickets. It had the winning numbers on the night, but two other winning tickets were also sold, so the syndicate could claim only one-third of the jackpot, or £568,682. Match-5 and match-4 prizes brought the syndicate's total winnings to approximately £1,166,000, representing a profit of approximately £310,000 before expenses. Klincewicz later appeared on the television talk show "Kenny Live" and wrote a self-published lottery-system book entitled "Win the Lotto." To prevent such a brute force attack from happening again, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/39 game later in 1992, raising the jackpot odds to 1 in 3,262,623. The first Lotto 6/39 drawing was held on 22 August 1992. To compensate for the longer jackpot odds, the National Lottery doubled the starting jackpot to and added a "bonus number" to the drawings. Whereas players previously needed either a match-6, match-5, or match-4 to win, prizes were now also awarded for match-5+bonus, match-4+bonus, and match-3+bonus. Lotto became a 6/42 game on 24 September 1994, which made the jackpot odds 1 in 5,245,786. The National Lottery made this change to generate bigger rollover jackpots, partly so that people living near the border with Northern Ireland would not abandon Lotto when the 6/49 British National Lottery began operations on 14 November 1994. At the same time, the National Lottery introduced computer-generated "quick picks" as an alternative to marking numbers on paper playslips. Some retailers now only offer the quick-pick option. For draws beginning on 26 September 1998, the National Lottery increased the cost of a line of Lotto from £0.50 to £0.75. At this time it also doubled the game's starting jackpot to £1 million and increased most of the game's smaller prizes by 50 percent. With the introduction of the euro currency on 1 January 2002, the cost of a line of Lotto became €0.95, and the starting jackpot became €1.269 million (the euro equivalent of £1 million). For draws beginning 1 September 2002, the price of Lotto was rounded to €1 per line, and the starting jackpot was raised slightly to €1.35 million. Core Lotto sales had declined steadily for six consecutive years up to 2006, falling from €314.9 million in 2000 to €255.1 million in 2006. Falling sales partly reflected public dissatisfaction with the game during the Celtic Tiger economic boom. As property prices and the cost of living escalated rapidly, particularly in Dublin, a €1.35 million starting jackpot was no longer seen as offering the transformed lifestyle promoted in lottery advertising. In November 2006, the National Lottery changed Lotto to a 6/45 game to create bigger jackpots and combat falling ticket sales. It made the starting jackpot a guaranteed €2 million, increased the match-5+bonus prize from €12,000 to €25,000, introduced a match-3 prize of €5, and increased the price of a line of Lotto from €1 to €1.50. The company said that the structural changes were designed to produce about twenty Lotto jackpots of €5 million and over each year, and at least one jackpot over €10 million. The first 6/45 draw was held on 4 November 2006. The odds of winning (in a 6/45 lottery) the Lotto jackpot are 1 in 8,145,060. The odds of getting a match-5+bonus are 1 in 1,357,510; the odds of a match-5 are 1 in 1,221,759; the odds of a match 4+bonus are 1 in 14,290; the odds of a match-4 are 1 in 148,995; the odds of a match-3+bonus are 1 in 579; and the odds of a match-3 are 1 in 14,190. The Wednesday night Lotto draw on 4 February 2015 was postponed until the following night due to a technical problem with ticket machines. This marked the first time in Lotto history that a drawing was postponed. As of 3 September 2015, the cost of buying two lines increased from €3 to €4 and players must now choose from 47 instead of 45 numbers, lengthening the odds of winning the jackpot to almost 11 million (approximately 10.7 million) to one. The odds against winning the second prize have increased also, but so too has the prize value, from €25,000 to an estimated €100,000. There will also be a new prize for matching 2 balls and the bonus ball. The current odds of winning (in a 6/47 lottery) are: Jackpot - 1 in 10,737,573; match 5 - 1 in 1,533,939; match 4 - 1 in 178,365; match 3 - 1 in 16,215. Lotto in Thailand In 2000, the National Lottery introduced Lotto Plus as an add-on to the main Lotto game. For an extra £0.25 per line, players could enter their Lotto numbers in an additional 6/42 drawing for a fixed, non-rolling jackpot of £250,000. The first Lotto Plus drawing took place on 25 October 2000. In 2002, the National Lottery added a second Lotto Plus drawing, renamed the drawings Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2, and raised the cost of Lotto Plus to €0.50 per line. The jackpots were fixed at €300,000 and €200,000 respectively. The first drawings for Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 took place on 1 September 2002. In November 2006, when Lotto adopted a 6/45 matrix, the National Lottery raised the Lotto Plus 1 and Lotto Plus 2 jackpots to €350,000 and €250,000 respectively. The cost of Lotto Plus remained at €0.50 per line. In September 2015, following the increase of two extra balls in the machine, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to €500,000. In 2018, the top prize of Lotto Plus 1 was doubled to €1000000. A Lotto Plus raffle was also introduced. Every player that matches the 4 digit raffle number wins €300. As with the main Lotto game, Lotto Plus players can win smaller cash prizes for match-5+bonus, match-5, match-4+bonus, match-4, and match-3+bonus. The odds of winning these prizes are the same as for the main Lotto game. On 30 August 2018, Lotto Plus was enhanced with the first price rise in 18 years now costing €1 per line to enter. The raffle prize was increased to €500, with special €1 million raffle draws taking place at special points throughout the year. They offered free Daily Million quick picks for matching 2 main numbers plus the bonus ball. This meant that the odds were better at 1 in 10 at winning a prize. Over 90 percent of Lotto players play Lotto Plus. Sales of Lotto Plus in 2012 were €74.3 million. Based around the main Lotto draw, Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 was introduced in February 1997. It allows players to win prizes by correctly matching one, two, three, four, or five of the drawn numbers. The more numbers players try to match, the greater the prize. Players may base their choices either on a six-number game (excluding the bonus number) or on a seven-number game (including the bonus number). Lotto 5-4-3-2-1 accounted for €13.1 million in sales in 2012. The National Lottery joined the transnational EuroMillions lottery on 8 October 2004. As of 2012, EuroMillions accounts for 24 percent of National Lottery sales. Several EuroMillions jackpots have been won or shared in Ireland: Irish sales of EuroMillions were €131.5 million in 2012, a 3.2 percent increase on the previous year. In June 2007, the National Lottery introduced "Plus," an add-on to the main EuroMillions game available only to Irish players. For an extra €1 per line, players can enter their five main EuroMillions numbers in an additional draw for a fixed, non-rolling prize of €500,000. Players can also win fixed prizes of €2,000 for a match-4 and €20 for a match-3. The first Plus drawing was held on 15 June 2007. 76 percent of EuroMillions players now play Plus. Sales of Plus were €44.6 million in 2012, an increase of 3.7 percent over the previous year. In September 2012, the National Lottery introduced Daily Million to replace both Monday Million (a draw game with prizes up to €1 million, held once weekly on Monday nights) and All Or Nothing (a daily draw game with prizes up to €500,000). A 6/39 weekly lottery drawing with a fixed, non-rolling jackpot of €1 million, Daily Million takes place every day of the week, including weekends and bank holidays. It costs €1 per line to play. For an extra €0.50 per line, players can play Daily Million Plus for a top prize of €500,000. The Daily Million/Daily Million Plus draws take place twice a day, every day (2pm and 9pm) at the National Lottery Headquarters under the supervision of Independent observers and National Lottery draw personnel. For some undisclosed reasons the National Lottery does not allow Daily Million Draws to be viewed by the public or streamed online. Introduced in October 2009, All or Nothing was the National Lottery's first daily draw game. Players choose 12 numbers from 24; if they got all the numbers correct, or none of the numbers correct, they won €500,000—a 1 in 1,352,078 chance of victory. The game had additional prizes of €5,000 for Match 11, €25 for Match 10, €10 for Match 9, and €4 for Match 8. Tickets cost €2 per line. The numbers were announced on RTÉ Two each night and also displayed through an animated draw on the Lottery website. The game had generated sales of €3.4 million by the end of 2009. The final draw took place on 10 September 2012. In the summer of 2008, the National Lottery ran its first Millionaire Raffle. These special, limited edition raffles have been held several times a year since then. Two Millionaire Raffle draws were held in 2011 and three in 2012. For the Easter 2013 Millionaire Raffle, 200,000 tickets were available, costing €20 each. The raffle had a top prize of €1 million, a second prize of €250,000, and two third prizes of €100,000. Players could also win a range of smaller prizes ranging from €10,000 to €250. In 2016 this was increased to 500,000 tickets, still costing €20 each then increased to €25 a ticket in 2017 with a similar breakdown of prizes. Professional footballer Kevin O'Connor won the 2017 Christmas Millionaire Raffle. The National Lottery introduced Telly Bingo in September 1999. Players buy tickets with 24 randomly generated numbers, and can win prizes by matching the numbers drawn on a lunchtime TV show in a variety of patterns, with a prize of €10,000 for a full house. An additional €10,000 Snowball prize goes to someone who achieves a full house on or before the 45th number drawn. If not won, the Snowball prize rolls over to the next draw, allowing one additional number each time. In 2012, Telly Bingo sales were €17.3 million. The National Lottery had a total of 23 scratchcard games on offer during 2019, ranging in price from €1 to €10, and offering instant cash prizes from €2 to €100,000. Sales of instant scratchcard games rose 3.2 percent to €163.5 million in 2012. The National Lottery funds the prize money for two televised game shows. Contestants gain entry to the shows by getting three "lucky stars" on associated scratchcards and submitting them in special envelopes for televised drawings. Broadcast on Saturday nights on RTÉ One since 1990, the game shows have proven very popular, often featuring among the channel's top-rated programmes. The National Lottery's flagship game show "Winning Streak" debuted in 1990 and screens weekly between September and early June. A summer companion programme "Fame & Fortune" was launched in 1996 and ran through the months of June, July, and August until 2007. It was replaced in 2007 by "The Trump Card", which was replaced in turn by "The Big Money Game", which was replaced by "The Million Euro Challenge". In the 1990s, RTÉ produced a sitcom called "Upwardly Mobile" about a working-class family who won the Lotto and moved to an upper-middle-class area. It ran for three seasons between 1995 and 1997. "Waking Ned" (known as "Waking Ned Devine" in North America) is a comedy film set in a tiny rural village, based on a fictitious winner of the Lotto. 

Flash trading, otherwise known as a flash order, is a marketable order sent to a market center that is not quoting the industry's best price or that cannot fill that order in its entirety. The order is then flashed to recipients of the venue's proprietary data feed to see if any of those firms wants to take the other side of the order. This practice enables the market center to try to keep the trade since the firm that is seeking to buy or sell shares or stock posts the information only on a specific stock exchange before sending the trade information out on the broader public markets, and making it available to all potential investors. If a deal can be struck between recipients of the flash trade, the result is a locked market with guaranteed pricing on the order. On some trades, it also results in better profits for the firms making the trades, as the firms often get rebates or lower fees for flash trades when the transaction is completed internally and doesn't get posted on rival stock exchanges. In 2009 in the United States under an exception to Rule 602 of Regulation NMS flash orders were allowed. In high-frequency trading flash orders for small amounts are utilised to find large orders so that the high frequency trader can buy or sell all available stock before the large order reaches the rest of the market. This may be done within a dark pool or over a number of electronic exchanges where the speed of the order routing is critical to the success of the strategy. According to the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by 2009 this practice had become controversial, with some market participants saying that high frequency traders could use flash orders to unfairly exploit others and that it is akin to front running. According to a 2009 Bloomberg article: Flash systems trace their roots as far back as 1978 to efforts by exchanges to electronically replicate how a trader might yell an order to floor brokers before entering it into the system that displays all bids and offers. Markets have evolved since the days of floor brokers’ dominance, with computer algorithms now buying and selling shares 1,000 times faster than the blink of an eye. In 2010 flash orders gained popularity in the options markets, where as early as 2000 the Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) began using the particular type of order to help improve the speed of trade executions for its clients. In 2006, Direct Edge began offering customers the ability to flash orders in the equities market. Direct Edge quickly captured market share from their rivals as their share of matched trades soared from 1% of the industry's volume to 12%. Direct Edge became a U.S. exchange in July 2010. Nasdaq and BATS (U.S. exchanges) created their own flash market in early 2009 in response to the Direct Edge market. Both voluntarily discontinued the practice in August 2009. Direct Edge's response to this in 2009 was that the data that flash trading used reduced market impact, increased average size of executed orders, reduced trading latency, and provided additional liquidity. Direct Edge also allowed all of its subscribers to determine whether they want their orders to participate in flash trading or not so brokers have the option to opt out of flash orders on behalf of their clients if they choose to. Because market participants can choose to utilize it for additional liquidity or not participate in it at all Direct Edge believes the controversy was overstated stating: "Misconceptions respecting flash technology have, to date, stirred a passionate but ill informed debate." Direct Edge 2009 In 2009 critics argued that the practice was harmful to market transparency. Proponents of flash trading stated that it is necessary to provide liquidity for exchanges. In 2009 critics of the practice (notably high-frequency trading firm GETCO ) contended this creates a two-tiered market in which a certain class of traders can unfairly exploit others, akin to front running. Exchanges in 2009 claimed that the procedure benefits all traders by creating more market liquidity and the opportunity for price improvement. However, a December 2009 article in The Banker noted: in a bid to fuel the controversy and fill column space, however, several commentators and pundits have complained bitterly that flashes expose information that may allow traders to ‘front-run’ orders. The widespread perception, meanwhile, that flash orders are the preserve of hyper-sophisticated high-frequency traders has further cemented the misguided notion that the lay retail investor is in turn being cheated. Direct Edge's response to the "two-tiered market" criticism is as follows: First it is difficult to address concerns that may result, particularly when there is no empirical data to support such as result. Furthermore, we do not view technology that instantaneously aggregates passive and aggressive liquidity as creating a two-tier market. Rather, flash technology democratizes access to the non-displayed market and in this regard, removes different "tiers" in market access. Additionally, any subscriber of Direct Edge can be a recipient of flashed orders. The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in September 2009 proposed banning the practice as part of regulatory reforms in the wake of the Financial crisis of 2007–2010. , the proposals have not been implemented. Even though most programs have been stopped voluntarily, it is still possible, at least with Direct Edge. In 2009 Sang Lee, managing partner at Aite Group, an independent research firm in Boston, saw the debate about flash orders as more philosophical than practical. Since the total market volume that goes through flash orders accounted for only 2% to 3% of daily volume in 2009, there would not be a big change in trade volume among major players if those orders disappeared. In 2009 Bogoslaw predicted that regardless of the endgame, there would always be differences in the speed of information-technology capabilities of market centers and market participants. He argued that as long as market centers competed for order flow, investors can benefit, even if participating is only through investments in mutual or pension funds. In 2009 large institutional investors benefit directly by having enough liquidity to move a big block of shares with minimal price impact. 

Kwara State University, also known as KWASU, is the 77th university to be registered by the Nigerian Universities Commission (NUC). It is the 95th university to be recognized in Nigeria. The university was established by the administration of Dr. Bukola Saraki in 2009, and envisioned to be more than a typical university in Nigeria. It was designed to be a center for community service and entrepreneurship. In a country where the fundamental values of volunteerism and community involvement are yet to be fully embraced, The university recognises itself as a part of a community, and has the position of a Director for Community Development for the purpose of mobilizing the community, setting assessment strategies, and identifying the needs within the community so that lecturers can use their expertise to impact directly on the communities.KWASU held her first convocation on 1 June 2013 and inaugurated KWASU Alumni Association. The journey towards establishing a state university in Kwara State began on 11 July 2007 when the Kwara State Governor Bukola Saraki inaugurated a Planning Committee under former Governor of Kwara State, Alhaji Mohammed Shaaba Lafiagi to prepare the ground for the establishment of the Kwara State University. The Bill for the Kwara State University was signed into law on 24 December 2008. The certificate and instrument to operate the university was obtained on 9 February 2009 from the National Universities Commission (NUC). The pioneer Vice-Chancellor, Professor Abdul Rasheed Na'Allah, who until his appointment, was Chair of the African American Studies Department of the Western Illinois University, Macomb, United States of America, assumed office on 28 July 2009. When fully operational, the university is planned to have its academic activities operate from three campuses located in Malete, Ilesha-Baruba and Osi-Opin. The Malete campus is the main campus and houses the College of Pure and Applied Sciences, College of Information and Communication Technology, and the College of Education. Osi (Ekiti local government) campus will house the College of Engineering, College of Humanities, Management, and Social Sciences. The Baruba (Baruten Local government) Campus will house the College of Agriculture and Veterinary Sciences. Kwara State University has several academic centers. One of such centers is the Center for Ecology and Environmental Management and Studies CEERMS, which recently received a grant from UNESCO worth $15.3 million to be used over a six-year period to establish the UNESCO Chair for Alternative Energy Programme. This grant is for research in Alternative Energy and is to be handled by Kwara State University Center for Ecological and Environmental Research Management Studies (CEERMS). Other centers of the University are: Center for Oral Traditions in Africa, Institute for Asian Studies, Institute for Advanced Military Studies, Japanese Language and Culture Institute, Ibrahim Gambari Center for the Study of United Nations and Regional Organizations, Center for Pre-degree and Remedial Studies, Center for Human Rights and the law, Center for Modernity and Religion, Center for Art Preservation, Center for Sponsored Projects, Center for Innovation in Teaching and Research, KWASU International Institute for Publishing Studies, Center for Innovative Technology, Center for Innovation and International Studies, Center for Bio-Computational Applications and the Center for Entrepreneurship.

The university works with students still in the university, to propose and implement a project. As the students graduate, the university partners with the students in implementing the various projects. It also created a start up fund that is accessible to student for this purpose. Presently, Kwara State University offers students an opportunity to propose their research projects to the school under the Undergraduate Research Day, an annual event where students of the institution present research work for funding and global recognition. While KWASU plans to expand its study abroad locations, it currently has a partnership with Thammasat University in Thailand; Korean Advanced Institute of Technology (KAIST), South Korea; Columbia University, New York, USA; University of the State of Bahia (UNEB), Salvador, Brazil; Texas Southern University, Houston, TX, USA; etc. Its teaching staff consists of scholars such as Prof. Leo Daniels, MLK Professor of Aeronautics and Astronautics at Massachusetts Institute of Technology, (MIT) as Provost at the College of Engineering and Technology, Prof. Abiola Irele from Harvard University as Provost at the College of Humanities, Management and Social Sciences; and Prof. Winston Wole Soboyejo from Princeton University among others. The National Universities Commission (NUC), has approved Aeronautical and Astronautical Engineering as a course in Kwara State University (KWASU). Being the first institution in Nigeria to offer a (B.Eng.) in Aeronautical and Astronautical engineering. A statement issued by the Vice Chancellor of the University, Professor Abdulrasheed Na'Allah "I must congratulate all our students and staff in Engineering, especially the department of aeronautical and astronautical engineering for their hard work and patience, that have led to this great success." 

Kaptallah was a historic Somali group. It established the port city of Bandar Qassim in the early 19th century, and traded with Persia, India and the Arabian peninsula. 

Dr. Steven Hayne was a pathologist from the US state of Mississippi who attracted significant controversy surrounding his medical practices and testimony in criminal trials, most notably those of Cory Maye, Jimmie Duncan, and Tyler Edmonds. He was born in Los Angeles, California, and he was named Steven Timothy Hoyne. It is unknown when he adopted the use of the last name Hayne. He graduated from Oakland Technical High School in 1959. Hayne graduated from Brown Medical School in 1974 and interned until 1976 at Letterman Army Medical Center in San Francisco, California. After finishing his internship, he practiced medicine in California, Kentucky, and Alabama, before settling in Mississippi in 1987. Until 2008, Hayne performed about 80 to 90 percent of criminal autopsies in Mississippi, and has testified to performing more than 1,500 autopsies per year. Performing more than 325 autopsies per year is considered a "Phase II deficiency" by the National Association of Medical Examiners, and prevents an office from being accredited. While performing these autopsies, Hayne also regularly appeared in court to testify as a forensic expert, and held down two hospital jobs. Hayne is the medical examiner in the Cory Maye case and testified at the trial for the murder of Ron Jones. In this testimony, "Hayne said he could tell from the damage to Jones’ body the trajectory the bullet took as it entered the officer. Based on that trajectory, he speculated that Maye was standing when he shot Jones, not lying on the floor, as Maye testified. Hayne’s testimony seriously damaged Maye’s credibility with the jury. However, according to a post-trial review by an actual, board-certified forensics expert whom Maye’s new legal team hired, it would be impossible to project the bullet’s trajectory based on the tissue damage in Jones’ corpse, because Jones might have been crouching, rolling, or prone when he was hit." Jimmie Duncan was convicted for the 1993 murder of Haley Oliveaux of West Monroe, Louisiana based primarily on the testimony of Hayne and Michael West, a dentist who claimed to identify bite marks and at the time coroner of Forrest County, Mississippi. Duncan had admitted to leaving Oliveaux in a bathtub unattended, and was initially charged with negligent homicide. Hayne examined Oliveaux and claimed to have found bite marks on her face that had not been seen by any of the other medical professionals who had previously examined her body, such as EMTs and hospital personnel. After this, a mold was taken of Duncan's teeth for use in bite mark analysis by Michael West. In performing this analysis, West repeatedly pressed the mold into the cheek of Oliveaux' corpse, creating bite marks which had not previously existed. This was recorded on videotape which surfaced in 2008. Michael Bowers, deputy medical examiner for Ventura County, California commented with regard to the bite marks that "Dr. West created them. It was intentional. He's creating artificial abrasions in that video, and he's tampering with the evidence. It's criminal, regardless of what excuse he may come up with about his methods." At 2004 the trial for the murder of Joey Fulgham (committed by his wife), in which his 13-year-old brother-in-law Tyler Edmonds was also tried and convicted, Hayne claimed to be able to determine from the bullet wounds received by Fulgham that Edmonds had also been holding the gun at the time the trigger was pulled. On appeal to the Mississippi Supreme Court this testimony was called "speculative" and "scientifically unfounded" by the court. Upon retrial in 2008, absent Hayne's testimony, Edmonds was acquitted.

The Nusantara Society () is a Russian non-profit learned society for research fellows, professors, lecturers, students and postgraduates of Moscow and St. Petersburg academic institutions, universities and higher schools, studying the vast region of Nusantara, populated by peoples speaking Austronesian languages. Nusantara includes Brunei Darussalam, Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Timor Leste, Madagascar, Oceania, as well as countries where Austronesian minorities are present, such as Singapore, Thailand, Vietnam and Taiwan (Republic of China). The Society was founded on January 10, 1990 on the basis of the Malay-Indonesian Readings. Later, in June 1998, the Nusantara Research Center was established at the Institute of Asian and African Countries at Moscow State University. The founder and the President of the Society till 2004 was Dr. B.B. Parnickel. The main aims of the Nusantara Society are as follows: The Nusantara Society cooperates closely with the Gorky Institute of World Literature under the Russian Academy of Sciences, the Margarita Rudomino All-Russia State Library for Foreign Literature and the Russian State Library, the Faculty of Oriental Studies at Saint Petersburg State University; Leiden University and the Royal Netherlands Institute of Southeast Asian and Caribbean Studies (KITLV) in the Netherlands, the University of Malaya, the Malaysian Institute of Language and Literature ("Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka") and other institutions abroad. A memorandum of understanding was signed with the Malaysian Institute of Language and Literature in 1995. In December 2017, Nusantara Society celebrated 50th anniversary of the Malay-Indonesian Readings (under the patronage of the academician A.A. Guber) which became the basis for the Nusantara Society. April 4, 2018, the 20th issue of the collection "Malay-Indonesian studies" was launched at the jubilee meeting of the society. The Nusantara Society is also engaged in publishing. Its publications include the "Malay-Indonesian Studies Series" (partly based on seminar papers) and miscellaneous studies on Nusantara culture (in cooperation with Saint Petersburg University). Up until 2019 there were 21 issues of "Malay-Indonesian Studies".

Grantham Museum is located at "St Peter's Hill", Grantham, Lincolnshire, England in the building provided for it in 1926. The building also housed the public library, and was partly funded by the Carnegie UK Trust which was continuing Andrew Carnegie's project of building libraries across the United Kingdom. Grantham's library is now located in the Isaac Newton Centre, and the museum occupies the whole of the 1926 building. The idea of a museum can be traced back to meetings of the Grantham Scientific society in the 1890s. The basis of the collection is material provided by Henry Preston, the first Curator and Founder, and twentieth century additions included material about Sir Isaac Newton, Edith Smith and Margaret Thatcher. There is also material about the Dambusters Raid. The Museum hosts a variety of exhibitions during the year. The museum is currently managed by the Grantham Community Heritage Association (GCHA). This charity was formed in 2011 to take over the management of the museum from Lincolnshire County Council with a view to reopening the facility for the Queen's Jubilee in June 2012. In 2013, a few months before the death of Margaret Thatcher, the GCHA announced plans to raise funds to obtain a statue of the former prime minister. 

Nicholas M. Nagy-Talavera or Miklós Nagy (February 1, 1929 – January 23, 2000) was a Hungarian-American dissident, historian, writer and professor, He was born to prosperous merchants of Sephardic Jewish descent and spent his childhood in Oradea, Romania. In 1944, when he was 14 years old, Nagy-Talavera was arrested by Hungarian police and handed over to German authorities, who transported him to Auschwitz concentration camp, where he encountered the notorious Joseph Mengele. He survived Auschwitz and returned to Budapest in 1945 to find that his parents had also survived the war by hiding with Christian friends. In 1948 Nagy-Talavera enrolled at the University of Vienna. Because of his dissident activities, he fell afoul of SMERSH, the Red Army's counter-intelligence branch.

2-Diphenylmethylpyrrolidine (Desoxy-D2PM), also known as 2-benzhydrylpyrrolidine, is a stimulant psychoactive drug. It is the 4-dehydroxylated structural analog of diphenylprolinol (D2PM), and is also similar in structure to desoxypipradrol (2-DPMP), both of which act as norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors (NDRIs). Like D2PM and 2-DPMP, Desoxy-D2PM is sold as a designer drug and has been used in the manufacture of legal highs. It has been marketed under the names A3A New Generation, A3A Methano, and Green Powder, and has been reported to cause hallucinations, violent behavior, dilated pupils, tachycardia, and high blood pressure. Literature data suggest that it can produce the same psychotropic effects as other stimulants, but with a longer duration of action. Desoxy-D2PM has two enantiomers which are used industrially in their purified form as chiral derivatizing agents during chemical synthesis. As of 4 November 2010, the UK Home Office announced a ban on the importation of 2-diphenylmethylpyrrolidine, following a recommendation from the ACMD. It was due to become a class B drug on 28 March 2012, but the bill was scrapped, due to the presence of two steroids included in the bill that were later recommended to remain uncontrolled. It was made a class B drug and placed in Schedule I on 13 June 2012.

So You Think You Can Dance is a televised dance competition and reality show that launched in the United Kingdom in January 2010 with a format based on an American show by the same name. The show was broadcast on BBC One. The presentation of the show is similar to that of the "Pop Idol" series of singing competitions, also created by Simon Fuller and Nigel Lythgoe. The show focuses not only on the dancers' talent, but also showcases new works by notable choreographers, crafted specifically for the dancers and the show. "So You Think You Can Dance" is hosted by British entertainer Cat Deeley, also the host of the U.S. version since season 2. In the initial televised audition phase of the show, contestants dance in front of the judges – Nigel Lythgoe, Louise Redknapp, Arlene Phillips and Sisco Gomez – in the hope of getting through to the "choreography camp" round. After a further selection process, the judges decide who they would like to perform during the live finals of the competition, during which the public vote for their favourite act following a weekly live performance by a celebrity performer. The show does not have a specific type of dance, contestants can do what dance style they choose. However, they will be asked to learn other dances throughout the competition. The first dancer to win the title of "Britain's Favourite Dancer" was Charlie Bruce, who won in 2010. It was initially announced that season two would have Alexandra Burke as a guest judge throughout the auditions and choreographer camp, to pull in more of the viewing audience. However, it was later announced that all four judges from season one would return as the main judges. "So You Think You Can Dance" first premiered on 2 January 2010, beginning with one audition show, introducing the top 14 and others at audition. Five elimination rounds were followed by a final, with performances and results shown on the same night. The winner would receive a prize, and would earn the title of "Britain's Favourite Dancer". The winner received £100,000 cash and a trip to Hollywood, where the winner performed in the U.S. season finale. The show was axed by BBC One due to the second series' low ratings and buying the broadcasting rights for the UK version of "The Voice". The contestants would be held at a "producers" audition before getting to the second round, which is known as the "judges auditions" this is to help limit the number of auditionees. During the second round dancers would auditions one by one in front of the panel of judges. This will make the judges decide if they would like to put the contestant through to the second round of the competition known as "choreography camp". The auditions are held around the UK in London, Manchester, Birmingham, Cardiff and Belfast. In order to find the next "British Favourite Dancer". However, a selection of auditions would only be shown on television. Judges will nominate whether they would like the contestant to continue in the competition. If three of the judges were to say "yes" and one judge to say "no" the contestant would go through. However, if two judges said "yes" and two judges said "no" you would not continue in the competition. The acts which the judges sent through to the next round would face "choreography camp".

Which they would be giving the time to spend and choreograph a type of performance the judges would ask for, (e.g. hip-hop, jazz, etc.). At the end of which the choreographers and judges chose the top 16. This would consist of the performances they give for the judges. They would be told straight after their performance if they would continue in the show. This is usually done gradually over the course of the entire week, with many dancers being cut from the competition on the very first day, and several more being cut each day, as the contestants are put through many different rounds to test their dance skills as well as their adaptability, learning speed, and stamina. Most rounds consist of the entire group of remaining dancers being taught a dance in a specific style (hip-hop, Broadway, and ballroom are among the most frequently-seen styles), and then performing the dance in front of the judges, a handful of contestants at a time. Another round consists of group work, where randomly chosen groups of four to six dancers are given a CD with a different song on it. Each group's members must then work together to create a choreographed group number for that song, and dance to it the next morning for the judges. At the end of this week of auditions, the judges meet and discuss each remaining dancer, to determine who will be chosen for the audience-vote portion of the competition (generally referred to as that season's "Top 20"). During the live finals stage, each remaining contestant will perform a dance for the judges and the live audience, week after week. The public would get choose who they want to remain the competition by voting. The bottom two will perform again and then the judges will decide which act they would like to see again in the competition. The season finale consists of the top 4, and in addition to their solos, each also dances several other numbers, while being paired or grouped with the other finalists in such a way that "everyone dances with everyone." In addition, during the grand finale, contestants who were eliminated that season come back, and that season's favorite dances are showcased.

The game takes place on Earth, where eight martial artists from around the planet compete against each other to fight and defeat the legendary master and reveal the secrets of Ta•o Taido. The game appears to be similar to other 2D versus fighting games during its release, but has different gameplay. The player's character fights against his or her opponent in single round matches in a single player tournament mode with the computer or against another human player, while using very simplistic commands that summon charging attacks. Players press and hold two out of three buttons down to charge up, then move the joystick toward a direction to perform an attack. The longer the players hold two buttons down, the more powerful and longer the attack gets and lasts; however, there are three levels of energy, and after the third and highest charge, it returns to the first and lowest charge. Short charges create weak moves, medium charges create moderate moves, and long charges create strong attacks. Both players have 3 levels of health in each round, instead of one like in most other fighting games. "Ta•o Taido" also has a cooperative 2-player feature similar to the ones in SNK's "Street Smart" and "". The controls can be switched to what most other fighting games have. Players have a character roster of eight fighters to choose from, and one unplayable boss. Each with their own unique fighting style and special techniques.

In March 2014, the lead single from their debut album, "Final Episode (Let's Change the Channel)" was certified gold by the RIAA. Asking Alexandria was one of the main headlining bands in the annual Never Say Never Festival on 12 March, along with Bring Me the Horizon also headlining the festival. They later embarked on another headlining tour in North America, dubbed as the 'Break Down The Walls' tour, starting in March and ending in April, with support acts August Burns Red, We Came as Romans, Crown The Empire and Born of Osiris. The band also performed in South Africa in May. In July, the band was announced as the nominees for "Alternative Press'" first Music Awards, nominated for Best Live Band and Best International Band and also performed at the ceremony itself, covering Duran Duran's Hungry Like the Wolf featuring guest vocals from Jonathan Davis. On 15 December 2014, the band released their first official live DVD titled "Live From Brixton And Beyond" which features the bands sold-out London show at the O2 Academy Brixton, as well as behind-the-scenes and backstage footage from the performance, it also includes the unseen Reckless Halloween performance at The Wiltern in Los Angeles, all of the band's music videos and the 'Through Sin and Self-Destruction' short film. On 22 January 2015, lead singer Danny Worsnop announced his departure from the band to focus on rock music with his new band We Are Harlot. He also stated that despite his departure, the band would continue touring. Lead guitarist Ben Bruce announced that there would be a new lead singer. Fans reacted to news in distress as they believe he was essential to the band's sound, while others were not surprised by his career move, some going as far to say he performs better with his new band We Are Harlot than he does with Asking Alexandria. When Bruce was queried regarding his status with Worsnop he stated that he felt abandoned long before his departure since Worsnop's lost the care for screaming and heavier music since their release of their second album, and continued to say that he wouldn't know if he could call him and Worsnop friends. When Bruce was asked regarding the sound of the fourth album, he stated that while it will feature influences of Guns N' Roses and Van Halen it will also feature influences from modern bands such as Avenged Sevenfold and Slipknot, stating that since the third album was such an unexpected change in musical style he believes that fans will expect further experimentation on the next, therefore having less backlash from their fan base. He has also stated that they started writing material for the album while on tour in summer of 2014 and had written around 18 tracks, and estimates that it will be released between July and August 2015. On 26 May 2015, Denis Stoff, formerly the guitarist and vocalist of Ukrainian metalcore bands Make Me Famous and Down & Dirty, was revealed as the new lead vocalist when the band released "I Won't Give In", their first single with him, on 27 May. Speculation regarding Stoff's involvement started shortly after Worsnop's departure due to similarities between Asking Alexandria and Make Me Famous (who were said to have been ripping off the band's sound); the fact that they were label mates would have made the transition easy for Stoff to make, and on his personal YouTube account he had covered multiple Asking Alexandria songs. Bruce was asked if he considered anyone else for the role and he stated that "It has to be Denis" going on to praise his much greater vocal range and since he was inspired by Worsnop in the earlier stages of Asking Alexandria he can perform their songs live much better than Worsnop could, however when Stoff himself was asked how he would distinguish himself from him, he stated he would not make any comparison since he is a completely different person. The band initially planned to perform for the first time with Stoff on 31 May at Manchester Academy 3 and at London Underworld a day after, however due to Stoff being unable to secure a visa in time for the shows, they had to cancel. They have also been announced as one of the acts for the 2015 Rock Am Ring and Rock Im Park Festivals in Germany in early June.<ref name="rock am ring / rock im park festivals 2015"></ref> The band also announced that they will be performing at the 2015 Vans Warped Tour. In October, on their headlining tour through Europe, the band announced that the original plan to release the album in October/November has changed and that the fans can expect the album in early 2016 with a new single & music video in November. In late December it was revealed that the album's title was going to be "The Black" and is expected to be released in March 2016, and will be supporting British metal band Bullet for My Valentine in North America from 2 February to 7 March, dubbed the British Invasion tour. In mid-October, it was speculated that the band had settled their differences with original lead vocalist Danny Worsnop and that some sort of collaborative effort would be made after several pictures were posted of Worsnop and Bruce in the studio together. However, it was revealed two days later that Worsnop had actually returned to the band as an official member after the departure of Denis Stoff. Ben Bruce explained that after a long period of time of not communicating with the band, Stoff stated, "Asking Alexandria does not exist unless I get what’s owed to me". Worsnop also opened up about his return to the band, stating that "this is something that [he] can embrace again". When the band performed again for the first time with Worsnop since Stoff's departure, their set list excluded all songs from their most recent album "The Black" and instead consisted of songs that they had not performed in years. This occurred just as the band headlined Sumerian's "Ten Years in the Black Tour" supported by Veil of Maya, Born of Osiris, I See Stars, Upon a Burning Body, After the Burial, and Bad Omens. As time went on more information regarding Stoff had been released, such as that Stoff had lip-synced the band's older songs during live performances, an accusation made by Worsnop's lawyers who notified him after sending Stoff a cease and desist. When asked about Stoff's time as his replacement, Worsnop replied stating that "Replace is a strong word. He was just keeping my seat warm. Honestly, I don’t know the kid so I have no opinion of him as a person…" Stoff claims that his departure was due to personal stress caused by the unrest in his home country of Ukraine. The band released their first studio material with Worsnop back in the band on 21 September 2017, the single "Into the Fire" which would be the lead single from their upcoming album. The band released a second single from the album, entitled "Where Did It Go?", on 25 October 2017. On 15 December 2017, the band released their self-titled fifth studio album. The album marked a significant stylistic shift from the band's earlier metalcore work, incorporating influences from a wide pool of genres including stadium rock. On 11 July 2019, the band released their new song called "The Violence". On 6 December, the band unveiled the dubstep remix of their song, "The Violence" by the electronic artist "Sikdope". The band would go on to finish the year off by re-releasing their fifth album as a belated Christmas present to fans and as an anniversary to their much acclaimed album. The re-release features six bonus tracks including a rock rendition of a previous track, a demo, an acoustic track, a cover and a mash-up. The band announced their headline tour after two years along with Falling in Reverse, Wage War and Hyro the Hero, the tour is called 'Like A House On Fire World Tour'. It is intended to be a world tour. On 11 February 2020, the band announced that a new single named "They Don't Want What We Want (And They Don't Care)" would premiere on Octane on 12 February. On 4 March, the band announced their upcoming sixth studio album titled "Like a House on Fire" set for release on 15 May 2020. At the same day, the band released the third single of the album titled "Antisocialist" and its corresponding music video. On 15 April, the band released the fourth single "Down to Hell" alongside an accompanying lyric video. On 11 May, four days before the album release, the band released their fifth single "House on Fire". The band's music has mostly been described as metalcore, but has also been labelled post-hardcore, screamo, hard rock, and heavy metal. Additionally, it was also sometimes described as electronicore on their early work. Their first two Sumerian albums, 2009's "Stand Up and Scream" and 2011's "Reckless & Relentless", are both generally considered to be metalcore albums, while their fourth album, 2013's "From Death to Destiny", is influenced by heavy metal and rock bands while maintaining Asking Alexandria's signature metalcore sound on certain tracks. Guitarist Ben Bruce has stated that they do not like writing music that sounds the same from album to album, which is why their musical style has changed over time. Ben Bruce has expressed the feeling that the band's lyrical style before "Reckless & Relentless" was immature. According to Bruce, the band wanted to move on from yelling out lyrics like "fuck" and "you stupid fucking whore" to a more mature style with more meaning. He stated that "From Death to Destiny" is lyrically their most mature album, no longer focusing on subjects such as drugs and women, and much more meaningful than their older lyrics. Danny Worsnop has claimed that the band's lyrics are never written before entering the studio and are always improvised during the recording of an album. All of the band's members have expressed their passion for 1980s rock music, and demonstrated it with releases such as the "Life Gone Wild" EP featuring covers of two Skid Row songs or the "" EP featuring covers of songs by bands such as Journey, Mötley Crüe, Whitesnake and Def Leppard. Their third studio album "From Death to Destiny" is heavily influenced by such bands. Some of their favorite artists include Guns N' Roses, Metallica, Mötley Crüe, Sebastian Bach, Skid Row and Van Halen, but they also take influence from modern bands such as Slipknot and Avenged Sevenfold.

In the mathematical field of graph theory, the Tutte 12-cage or Benson graph is a 3-regular graph with 126 vertices and 189 edges named after W. T. Tutte. The Tutte 12-cage is the unique (3-12)-cage . It was discovered by C. T. Benson in 1966. It has chromatic number 2 (bipartite), chromatic index 3, girth 12 (as a 12-cage) and diameter 6. Its crossing number is 170 and has been conjectured to be the smallest cubic graph with this crossing number. The Tutte 12-cage is a cubic Hamiltonian graph and can be defined by the LCF notation [17, 27, –13, –59, –35, 35, –11, 13, –53, 53, –27, 21, 57, 11, –21, –57, 59, –17]. There are, up to isomorphism, precisely two generalized hexagons of order "(2,2)" as proved by Cohen and Tits. They are the split Cayley hexagon "H(2)" and its point-line dual. Clearly both of them have the same incidence graph, which is in fact isomorphic to the Tutte 12-cage. The Balaban 11-cage can be constructed by excision from the Tutte 12-cage by removing a small subtree and suppressing the resulting vertices of degree two. The automorphism group of the Tutte 12-cage is of order and is a semi-direct product of the projective special unitary group PSU(3,3) with the cyclic group Z/2Z. It acts transitively on its edges but not on its vertices, making it a semi-symmetric graph, a regular graph that is edge-transitive but not vertex-transitive. In fact, the automorphism group of the Tutte 12-cage preserves the bipartite parts and acts primitively on each part. Such graphs are called bi-primitive graphs and only five cubic bi-primitive graphs exist; they are named the Iofinova-Ivanov graphs and are of order 110, 126, 182, 506 and 990. All the cubic semi-symmetric graphs on up to 768 vertices are known. According to Conder, Malnič, Marušič and Potočnik, the Tutte 12-cage is the unique cubic semi-symmetric graph on 126 vertices and is the fifth smallest possible cubic semi-symmetric graph after the Gray graph, the Iofinova–Ivanov graph on 110 vertices, the Ljubljana graph and a graph on 120 vertices with girth 8. The characteristic polynomial of the Tutte 12-cage is It is the only graph with this characteristic polynomial; therefore, the 12-cage is determined by its spectrum.

The State of Vermont has the highest number of covered bridges per square mile in the United States. Not surprisingly, replica covered bridges have also been built throughout the state to capture the essence of the historic bridges. Non-authentic covered bridges are those that do not use traditional truss construction. Usually they are built with stringer construction. This list is bound to be incomplete as "backyard bridges", as most of these can be, are not publicized. The "access" column indicates whether the bridge is publicly accessible or not. Longitude and latitude coordinates are given when confirmed either by personal observation or satellite imagery.

The leaky homes crisis is an ongoing construction and legal crisis in New Zealand concerning timber-framed homes built from 1988 to 2004 that were not fully weather-tight. The problems often include the decay of timber framing which, in extreme cases, have made buildings structurally unsound. Some buildings have become unhealthy to live in due to moulds and spores developing within the damp timber framing. The repairs and replacement costs that may have been avoided were estimated in 2009 to be approximately NZ$11.3 billion. The Building Act 1991, which became law in 1993, changed building controls from a prescriptive system to a more self-regulated regime. In addition, the Government dropped the apprentice training system for builders and the related building trades. Some developers and builders knowingly or carelessly constructed buildings with numerous faults and short-cuts. An architectural design trend towards Mediterranean-style houses with complex roofs, plastered exterior walls, internal decks and small or no eaves also factored in. Some local authorities were later found to have issued Building Consents based on insufficient documentation, failed to carry out inspection of the work during construction, and issued code compliance certificates for buildings which were later found to have leaking problems. Consequently some councils now share significant financial responsibilities with the builders (which in many cases have closed or otherwise removed themselves from liability) and the owners. Court cases have generally assigned around one third of the financial responsibility to local authorities. A 2013 Supreme Court case involving the Auckland City Council extended the liability of local bodies. There are many reasons that some buildings from the late 1980s were leaky. A major one was the increase in the use of cladding systems such as fibre cement sheet (generic name "Fibrolite" in New Zealand) and EIPS (Externally Insulated Plaster System) that relied on a paint finish as the primary defence against water ingress. This system is very similar to Exterior insulation finishing system (or EIFS). Such cladding systems typically allowed for little construction or thermal movement so that fine cracks that appeared insignificant, and would have been relatively insignificant in traditional claddings such as weatherboard, allowed continuous ingress of moisture into the framing. These causes, combined with the reduced air movement through the prevalence of sheet cladding or sheet insulating materials for the monolithic look cladding, resulted in very damp conditions which are ideal for rot. A further exacerbating factor that resulted in more significant damage from the leaks, was the change to the New Zealand Standard for Timber Treatment in 1995, allowing the use of untreated "Pinus radiata" timber for wall framing. As this timber has little natural resistance to rot when wet, damage occurs more quickly. In many cases claddings were not used within their specifications or not installed correctly. Many buildings built in the "Mediterranean" style used these types of cladding and had features such as recessed windows, flat roofs, minimal eaves, multiple storeys, complex roofs, solid balustrades, balconies and penetrations of the exterior cladding that increased the likelihood of water infiltrating the structure. Lack of detailed drawings for buildings was also a contributing factor. Some builders were unable to make a weathertight structure without proper guidance. This has partially been blamed on the breakdown of the apprenticeship system and unqualified builders in the marketplace. Council staff carrying out building inspections had neither the required construction expertise to ensure weathertightness nor the intuition to look for it. A likely major contributing factor was the exhaustion of New Zealand's "First Rotation" (50-60 year old) Pinus Radiata crop in the late 1980s, and the change to using short rotation 25-30 year old Pinus Radiata at the same time. The "new crop" Radiata timber was found, in an "unpleasant surprise" to consist near entirely of juvenile sapwood, - a type of wood found in only limited quantities in traditional forestry timbers and classified as a type of "abnormal" or "atypical" wood. Juvenile wood (aka apically influenced wood, aka core-wood) is present in all trees in small amounts near the center of the trunk, with the remainder of the wood comprising mature wood, and there being a spectrum in the change in cellular qualities outwards from the core from the most pronounced juvenile wood to normal mature wood. With age, the juvenile wood and mature wood is progressively converted to heartwood, stabilising it to a degree, so a tree can have juvenile sapwood, juvenile heartwood, mature sapwood and mature heartwood. Juvenile wood of both types is intrinsically inferior in all functional qualities to mature wood, but juvenile sapwood is the most problematic. A peculiar aspect of some conifers, which would appear to be a fire-adaption, is that when growing in post-fire environments or plantation forestry environments, production of juvenile wood is exaggerated and continues to a greater extent (in terms of number of annual growth rings outwards from the core) than in other woods. This is intrinsically linked to an unusually rapid rate of growth, such as seen in Radiata. New Zealand Radiata had always had more juvenile wood present than found in traditional forestry species. This had previously caused substantial problems in construction use in the 1950s and 1960s, but these had greatly diminished by the 1970s when Radiata's use became mainstream. This was because (a) the then advanced age of the First Rotation crop meant that much more of the first/butt log of each tree consisted of mature sapwood and juvenile heartwood; and (b) most of the first rotation had not been pruned, resulting in much of the worst of the central core of juvenile wood already being excluded by virtue of comprising a large "defect core" resulting from the unpruned branches. All of that changed at the end of the 1980s with the second-rotation, when for the first time since the 1950s and 1960s large quantities of juvenile sapwood started to hit the market. This was exacerbated by much of the mature wood being preferentially diverted to non-structural uses, in particular as clear-board timber, which was achieving a higher price. While in the 50's and 60's use of Radiata in construction was heavily promoted, by the 1960's its use was not recommended by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute or the New Zealand Institute of Forestry in their publications for any exterior residential construction, no matter how treated, due to its instability issues. Such use remained illegal under local building regulations throughout much of the Country as at 1960. Its use in framing remained (contrary to much currently published material) limited and near experimental in nature. Even by the early-mid 1970s a minority of New Zealand homes used Radiata in framing, and Radiata was typically more expensive to use than native woods. The 1970s was the time period which saw a changeover from native timbers being the mainstay of construction, and arguably it was not until the 1980s when having a combination of both Radiata framing and Radiata cladding became at all mainstream. As warned by New Zealand's Forest Research Institute in 1992, some four years after significant quantities of the new crop started being used in construction but before the Leaky Homes crisis emerged, the new timber was problematic. Specifically, it was of lower strength, was prone to more distortion and surface checks, had low density, high spiral grain, and abnormal longitudinal shrinkage (and expansion). The latter quality had been blamed overseas for excessive movement in response to atmospheric conditions. Overseas studies of similar short-rotation produced juvenile sapwood had concluded it was so different from "normal" wood that it would be wise to treat it as though it were a completely different species. New methodologies to utilize the wood would have to be developed. Arguably the greatest issue was its significant longitudinal shrinkage and expansion (some seven times, on average, greater than any wood previously used in modern construction) and since shown to be sufficient to buckle structural members and associated cladding and roofing materials. Such movement was, and continues to be, of particular significance for rigid exterior claddings which during the Leaky Building crisis were found to have been suffering cracking, and the entry of water through capillary action, at an unprecedented rate. Similar failures had been experienced in British Columbia from the early to mid-1980s when quantities of its "Second Growth" structural timbers began to enter the market, with those timbers too containing unprecedented amounts of juvenile sapwood. The United States had also in the early 1980s seen a small spate of significant construction failures due to the presence of juvenile sapwood in plantation grown Loblolly Pine that was entering the market, which led to much of the early research on the topic. A crash research-project by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute to, amongst other objectives, attempt to identify how the new crop Radiata could safely be used in construction took place between 1995 and 1998 . That project gave rise to many of the innovations and regulatory measures later implemented to attempt to allow for safe construction using juvenile sapwood including, notably, the rise of LVL and other laminated structural products. However intrinsic, and to date intractable, problems remain. The cellular structure of the wood is so non-durable and unstable (containing cell walls of completely distinct chemical and physical composition compared to normal wood)that even boron treated Radiata has exceedingly low durability, - indeed indistinguishable from untreated Radiata in graveyard testing. The sheer instability of modern Radiata means modern homes rely predominantly upon extensive flashings and moisture barriers to protect structural elements. The added complexity, cost, and often experimental nature of these systems renders homebuilding and maintenance a far more challenging exercise than previously the case. Such moisture barriers by their very nature tend to trap humidity, and because boron treated Radiata sapwood framing (juvenile or not) remains vulnerable to mould (and indeed boron actively encourages the growth of some moulds) modern New Zealand homes tend to suffer persistent, atypical, mould problems. Interbreeding with failed "improved" strains of Radiata produced in the 1970s has, since the 2000s, further reduced wood density by an average of approx 10%. Kiln drying, near ubiquitous since 1990, has recently, unexpectedly, been found to significantly increase permeability of Radiata by action upon resin ducts. Significantly New Zealand's exports of Radiata timber for structural use remains near nil, with the few trading partners who do allow use of New Zealand Radiata for construction tending to have express restrictions in place to attempt to exclude the worst of the juvenile wood. The Building Act 1991 was replaced by the Building Act 2004, which introduced a licensing scheme for building designers, builders and related trades. Councils were required to be registered with a central authority and were to be subject to regular quality control procedure checks. Council building inspectors remain unlicensed. The Government dissolved the BIA (Building Industry Authority, the Government department which was responsible for the oversight and administration of the building sector) on 30 November 2004 and replaced it with DBH (Department of Building and Housing). Some of the Acceptable Solutions to the Building Code were re-written, most notably E2/AS1 External Moisture which covers the detailing of roofs and walls was greatly expanded. The Standard covering durability of timber framing was amended in late 2003 with the publication of NZS 3602: 2003 Timber and Wood-based Products for Use in Building. This revision required a return to the use of treated radiata framing in external walls. The Overview Group on the Weathertightness of Buildings that was appointed by the Building Industry Authority ("the BIA") to investigate the causes of the leaky building crisis did receive several submissions (including from the New Zealand Institute of Forestry, but not apparently from the New Zealand Forest Research Institute) suggesting that the reduced rotation age of the then current Radiata Crop might be a causal factor in the leaky building crisis. In its final 2002 report the Overview Group recommended to the BIA that research be conducted as to whether there were any "issues regarding the structural strength and durability with respect to the maturity of timber". The outcome of that recommendation is currently unknown, with the Ministry of Business, Innovation and Employment advising in July 2019 that it had been unable to locate any records at all relating to any research or consultation having been undertaken in response to the Overview Group's recommendation. Short rotation juvenile sapwood continues to be used throughout home construction in New Zealand, as the same cell-wall abnormalities which render it problematic for construction purposes render it vastly cheaper to process for pulp, and the short rotation is eminently suitable for the production of cheap "wood" for non-structural manufacturing use. A return to 50-60 year crop rotations remains unlikely, as the 25 year crop rotation was only recommended and adopted in the late 1960s due to (a) the lack of profitability of the 50-60 year crop rotation in terms of producing structural timber, and (b) in recognition that even the 50-60 year rotation was incapable of producing structural timber of a quality which would have any material international demand. While concerns were raised regularly by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute in published studies from 1980 onwards as the adequacy of the likely qualities of the Second Rotation's short-rotation crop, the reality was that by 1988 there were insufficient other domestic timber resources (other than native trees, which required conservation) that could meet New Zealand's demand for structural timber. While considerable research continues by the New Zealand Forest Research Institute into the divergent anatomical, physical and chemical properties of juvenile sapwood, and scientific papers on the topic are regularly published by it, since the Leaky Homes Crisis emerged there has been little if any further published mention by it (or any Government body) of any possibility of juvenile wood causing construction failures, let alone linking juvenile wood to the Leaky Homes Crisis. Most current Government and industry publications, in defiance of the contemporaneous historical records, present the Leaky Homes Crisis as being an anomaly, and present Radiata as having been the predominantly used construction timber in New Zealand since 1945 (some 25 years before its actual use became at all prevalent). Consequently, few of the public in New Zealand (or even in the construction industry) have any awareness that the Radiata used in house construction in New Zealand since the late 1980s has been substantially different, and worse, than prior Radiata or Australian Radiata. Nor do many appreciate that the Radiata in structural use prior to the late 1980s was regarded by the industry and Government as being not only an expensive failure but also as being of extremely low quality. Nor is there any general awareness of how extensive the changes that have had to be implemented have been (to the extent of having to reformulate glues and resins to work with the new wood) to allow modern houses constructed using juvenile sapwood to stand any reasonable chance of lasting even 50 years, or of how unusual our residential construction remains relative to international practice and performance criteria. Accordingly no legal responsibility, or even criticism has ever rebounded onto the industry, or Government in relation to the use of short rotation and/or juvenile sapwood. Several thousands of homes throughout the country are still awaiting renovation, with a total cost that has been estimated by a Price Waterhouse Coopers report to the Government in 2008 as being around NZ$11.3 billion for a "consensus estimate" of 42,000 buildings. Other building experts estimate the true cost at $23 billion for 89,000 buildings, and accused government of reducing the figure of affected buildings to 42,000 buildings because they were allegedly "unhappy" with the expert prediction. The majority of affected buildings are homes or apartments, but in 2011 the twenty-year-old Ronald McDonald House for children with cancer and their families at Wellington Hospital was demolished as leaky and replaced. The Minister of Education said in 2009 that at least 73 schools were affected, and in 2011 that 157 schools still needed repairs, at an estimated cost of at least $1.5 billion As of 2013 the Ministry of Education was taking action against architects and builders involved with 87 of the 309 schools which have "leakiness" problems. One school in Wellington, Seatoun School, built at a cost of $5.3 million and opened in 2002 is costing $4.5 million to repair. As of mid-2009, plans for an up to NZ$6 billion bailout package shared between government and local authorities are in doubt because the amount could affect New Zealand's international credit rating. In November 2009, the National government decided not to offer a more substantial sharing of costs, and it is now estimated that in most cases, around 64% would have to be borne by the owners, 26% by Councils, and only 10% by government funds, while also forcing homeowners to sign away their rights to sue for more. Prime Minister John Key noted that while claimants did not have to accept the settlement, legal costs for bringing suit could eat up any further money awarded to them. Some claimants have taken negligence claims against company directors of construction companies, relying on the decision in "Morton v Douglas Homes Ltd" [1984] 2 NZLR 548. There have also been accusations that parts of the legal and inspection professions are profiting substantially from disputes around the cases, and that significant money was diverted into these channels rather than into fixing the buildings. The government's position was assailed by mayors of affected Councils and by pundits, who noted that by paying only 10%, and then receiving 12.5% back in goods and services tax, the government was actually making money from the crisis. Another report commissioned by North Shore City Council estimated a potential gain by government of up to $2 billion. Further, National was also criticised that as an opposition party, they had constantly asked for the then Labour-led government to assist homeowners financially. The government has also imposed a 10-year limit (after construction) on claims, even though some building experts believe many cases will only become apparent during coming years, as building rot becomes advanced enough. They also warned that houses in drier parts of New Zealand were now starting to show problems, which had simply developed at a slower pace – and that despite Building Act reforms in 2004, there were still houses being built that leaked badly due to shoddy workmanship. Timber needs a sustained period of wetting to form mould and subsequently rot. In laymens terms, the timber has to be wet longer than it is dry. In drier areas of the country it is unlikely the timber will remain wet long enough to instigate mould formation. In February 2010, New Zealand's Building and Construction Minister Maurice Williamson, National, warned that the size of the issue, at least $11 billion, was so gianormous [sic] that even a government with budget surpluses would struggle. He noted that: "...a Government who's [sic] running deficits - and has a forecast track of deficits for many years out - has to just sit there with its head in its hands, saying, 'Well, I just don't how to do this'." He also warned that it was necessary to come up with a solution so money could be spent on fixing houses, rather than paying lawyers, and that there was a risk of significant rates rises in the major centres like Auckland, Tauranga, Wellington and Christchurch, of a scale that would "make eyes water". In May 2010 the New Zealand Government launched the Financial Assistance Package (FAP) for leaky homes. Under the scheme, the home owner shares the agreed cost of repairing their home with the government and the local council, if the council approved the original work and is participating in the scheme. The government and the council each contribute 25% of the repair cost with the owner paying the remaining 50%. Despite the FAP offering to give the homeowners the certainty of financial contribution and to help get leaky homes fixed faster, by November 2012 only 12 victims had received final payouts under the government scheme. In 2009 it was estimated between 22,000 and 89,000 properties were affected, but the government's scheme would cover around 3,500 at the most. Councils and politicians have indicated that the crisis could increase rates bills. From mid-2011, council must take leaky home syndrome into account when re-valuing homes, even if the home has not leaked. This takes into account that such homes face widespread stigma and are harder to sell. The lower values meant some owners paid 5% to 20% less for their rates, but other ratepayers had to pay more to make up the difference. The placing into liquidation of Mainzeal Construction and Property, New Zealand’s third largest construction company, in February 2013 was blamed on both a slowdown in commercial construction work and liability for several leaky apartment buildings in Auckland and Wellington where other parties had gone out of existence. A similar problem arose in the early 1980s, some 10 years before New Zealand and for similar reasons in the Canadian province of British Columbia. It is commonly known in Canada as the Leaky condo crisis and has been an ongoing issue that is estimated to have caused $4 billion in damage since the 1980s. 

Pomegranate Festival is an annual cultural festival that is held in Goychay, Azerbaijan. The festival features Azerbaijani fruit-cuisine mainly the pomegranates from Goychay. At the festival, a parade is held with traditional Azerbaijani dances and Azerbaijani music. There are also several competitions such as; "the biggest pomegranate" or "pomegranate eating competition". The festival usually takes place in October, and attracts about 5000 to 7000 visitors. Goychay Pomegranate Festival was held for the first time on 3 November 2006 jointly by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism of the Republic of Azerbaijan and the Executive Authority of the Goychay Region. Indeed, starting from 2006, the festival have been held annually in every autumn (mainly in Octaber) displaying original dishes from different varieties of pomegranate. In fact, the spectators and participants of the festival expand each year. In 2013, Representatives from approximately 20 foreign countries participated in the event along with the state and government officials. Goychay is considered the pomegranate capital of Azerbaijan because many varieties of pomegranates are grown in the city. The most famous sorts of pomegranate are Veles, Shirin, Gyuleysha and Shihbaba. Therefore, the city has been chosen as the location for the festival. The festival features a fair and an exhibition that displays different varieties of pomegranates as well as various pomegranate products produced by local enterprises. During the festival national music such as mugham and different folklore examples are presented every year. Participants of the event are familiarized with the exhibition of hand-made products from the residents of the region.  The pomegranates that grown in separate villages of Goychay region and the products that made of pomegranate like juice, juice concentrates, jam, jelly, grenadine, wine, seeds in syrup are brought to the district center and displayed at the exhibition organized at the city square. The festival also includes young athletes’ performances and concert programs that are available to watch in the city center. The guests can see various the craftsmen, master craftsmen, potters, millers, blacksmiths, artists and dancers, athletes and performances of folklore groups, as well children's drawings, paintings, music, songs and dances. The activities within the festival changed over years and gained more spectators and participators. Types of events in the festival include ceremonies, competitions, dancing events, fairs, parades, performances, etc. For example, the 10th festival of the pomegranate opened with the participation of music and dance groups.2. The competitions at the festival such as the fastest eating of pomegranates, the ability to squeeze pomegranate juice, and the biggest pomegranate are held annually. In 12th festival of the pomegranate the contest "the most beautiful pomegranate girl" was held. Quba Apple Festival Pomegranate Producers and Exporters Association of Azerbaijan 

Randy Skretvedt (born November 1958) is an American film and music scholar, author, lecturer and broadcaster. His 1987 book "Laurel and Hardy: The Magic Behind the Movies" (updated in 1996) is the reference standard for Laurel and Hardy fans (known as "Sons of the Desert" after their appreciation society, which itself derives from the 1933 Laurel and Hardy film of the same name). In 2016, Skretvedt put the book through a massive update and enhancement, retitling it LAUREL AND HARDY: THE MAGIC BEHIND THE MOVIES (ULTIMATE EDITION) and publishing it through Bonaventure Press as an oversized 8-1/2 x 11 hardcover book, increasing the text by 50% and quadrupling the number of pictures included. Early supporters of the Kickstarter campaign for this edition also received a custom audio CD of selected excerpts from Mr. Skretvedt's interviews with Laurel and Hardy colleagues and co-workers. Skretvedt is also the host of the radio show "Forward Into the Past", which airs weekly on KSPC-FM in Claremont, California (88.7-FM and KSPC online). His "nom de heterodyne" is Randy Brian. Skretvedt's interests in vintage media started in childhood and range across the board, including films, music and radio. His primary area of focus is the period between the world wars: the 1920s, '30s and '40s. His penchant for collecting was evident early on; even as a child he began acquiring books, records, memorabilia, rare photos, letters, ephemera, documents – even Super 8mm prints of classic film comedies. He was a precocious communicator: his professional writing began at just 16, when he wrote a series of articles for "Private Screenings", a magazine devoted to vintage movies. It was only natural that a Laurel and Hardy fan with an interest the intensity of Skretvedt's would find his way to The Sons of the Desert, the international appreciation society for the duo. Skretvedt joined as a young teen and immediately recognized that the surviving members of Laurel and Hardy casts and crews were not going to be around forever, so he commenced interviewing them and cultivating the "inside stories" that would become the backbone of his work. Although he came along too late to interview either Laurel or Hardy, Skretvedt did debrief Oliver Hardy's widow, Stan Laurel's daughter, actors Anita Garvin and Dorothy Granger, music director Marvin Hatley, effects chief Roy Seawright, film editor Richard Currier and many, many other of their co-stars, directors and technicians. Perhaps his crowning interview – certainly in prestige if not necessarily in the forthrightness of its subject – was with Hal Roach, studio boss of "The Lot Of Fun," Roach Studios, where "The Boys" did all their best work. Skretvedt had not a moment to spare in his archival work: most everyone who worked directly with Laurel and Hardy in any capacity has since died. Skretvedt's interest in the popular culture from the first half of the 20th century doesn't end with film and cinema; he is also a fan of, and an authority on, the music of the time. His activities as a determined collector extend into the musical realm as well. He is rightly proud of his amazing "Barn Full O’ Records", a carpeted, air-conditioned shrine to all things musical from the early 1900s to the 1960s. Shelves of neatly organized 78rpm records reveal years of collecting, researching and cataloging dedication; additional stacks of CDs, tapes, 33- and 45-rpm records – plus the vast array of apparatus needed to play them all back – make it one of the most significant private archives of its kind. Skretvedt estimates the collection includes over 30,000 recordings. Skretvedt's vast music archive performs a public service function: it provides the playlist for "Forward Into The Past", the weekly radio program that Skretvedt hosts under the moniker Randy Brian. The three-hour program features two hours of primarily '20s, '30s and '40s music – mostly jazzy danceband numbers and some novelty records – flanking a central hour of vintage radio, comedy or drama. The program debuted in 1982. "Forward Into The Past" airs Sunday afternoons at 2 pm (PT) on KSPC 88.7 FM in Claremont, California and online at kspc.org. Skretvedt has penned many magazine articles and liner notes for over 25 albums. His books include:

Alfred Sturm (23 August 1888 – 8 March 1962) was a German general during World War II. During the Battle of Crete, Sturm (then an "Oberst") was commander of the 2nd Parachute Rifle Regiment. On 20 May 1941, he jumped from an aircraft over Crete and landed west of the Pigi airfield, a key objective, near Rethymno (Retimo). Sturm was captured as a POW on 21 May 1941 by soldiers of the Greek 4th Infantry Regiment, and delivered to the headquarters of the Australian 2/11th Battalion for imprisonment. For 10 days Sturm was held in a makeshift POW camp at Pigi village. As a commissioned officer (and in accordance with German military practices), at Sturm's own request he was held in a place separate from German enlisted personnel. Sturm was awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross for his actions at Crete.

The Tracking & Imaging Radar (TIRA) system serves as the central experimental facility for the development and investigation of radar techniques for the detection and reconnaissance of objects in space, and (to a certain degree) of air targets. TIRA has a 34-metre parabolic dish antenna is a monopulse radar operating at 1.333 GHz or 22.5 cm (L band) and 16.7 GHz or 1.8 cm (Ku band) wavelengths. The L-band is usually used for tracking debris with a 0.45° beam width, at 1 MW peak power. The system is capable of determining orbits from direction angles, range and Doppler shift for single targets. The detection size threshold is about 2 cm at 1000 km range. The radar conducts regular ‘beam park’ experiments, where the radar beam is pointed in a fixed direction on the celestial sphere for 24 hours, scanning 360° in a narrow strip a complete Earth rotation. The tracking sensitive can be enhanced when the TIRA system is used as a transmitter, part of a bistatic radar system. In conjunction with the Effelsberg Radio Telescope, functioning as a receiver, the combined system has a detection size threshold of 1 cm. The Ku-band is used for imaging in Inverse Synthetic Aperture Radar (ISAR) mode, with 13 kW peak power, the radar is capable of producing images with range resolutions better than 7 cm. The dish can be turned full 360° in azimuth with speed of 24° per second and 90° in elevation. The radar is protected by a radome with 47 meters diameter – one of the largest in the world. Due to its capabilities, the system is used as a radar tracking system for space debris and other in-orbit object in the ESA's Space Situational Awareness Programme (SSA). TIRA is located at the FGAN () site, in Wachtberg near Bonn, Germany. It is run by the Fraunhofer-FHR – the Fraunhofer-Institut für Hochfrequenzphysik und Radartechnik (High Frequency Physics and Radar Techniques).

Nimmagadda Prasad (born 11 October 1961) is an Indian industrialist from Andhra Pradesh, India, known for his ventures in the Pharmaceutical and Television industries, and is involved in philanthropic activities through "Nimmagadda Foundation". With master's degrees in Physics and Business Administration, Prasad made a humble beginning as a company executive. With over 15 years of professional experience in multinational pharmaceutical environment, Prasad turned entrepreneur in the year 2000 by acquiring a sick pharmaceutical company in Hyderabad, and made it a great turnaround company, Matrix Laboratories Limited. With good product innovation, manufacturing scale, leadership, global marketing footprint and M&A Strategy, Prasad steered Matrix Laboratories as one of the major pharmaceutical companies in India. In a span of 6 years, Prasad built Matrix to a US$1.03 Billion value enterprise before it was acquired by US-based in 2006. Prasad has played a vital role in establishing Care Hospitals and Asian Institute of Gastroenterology (AIG), two leading healthcare centres started in Hyderabad. He served as a board member and was also an investor with both. Prasad continued his entrepreneurial journey by acquiring Maa TV in 2006 and made it a leading Telugu General Entertainment Channel network. The revenue of the company has grown to Rs.350 Crores in 7 years. In the year 2015, Maa TV was acquired by Star TV, a wholly owned subsidiary of Rupert Murdoch-owned 21st Century Fox for a consideration of about Rs. 2,300 Crore. In 2008, Prasad joined as a local partner with the Government of Ras al-Khaimah for the implementing of a mega infrastructure project under the umbrella of VANPIC for the development of a world-class port-based integrated industrial corridor in the coastal region of Andhra Pradesh. This project was expected to transform the hitherto agri-based Guntur and Prakasam districts of Andhra Pradesh into major industrial hubs. With regards to VANPIC project, Prasad is embroiled in the alleged disproportionate assets case against Y S Jaganmohan Reddy, President of YSR Congress, Currently, Prasad has forayed into sports as a business by partnering with Sachin Tendulkar, Chiranjeevi and Allu Arvind. Their Consortium owns teams across different sports: The consortium actively promotes grassroots and youth development programs for all these sports. Prasad contributed substantially towards the establishment of Pullela Gopi Chand’s badminton academy in its formative years Along with actor Akkineni Nagarjuna, Prasad is one of the major shareholders of the popular TV channel Maa TV. In 2006, Prasad sold off his majority shares in Matrix Pharmaceutical to Mylan Laboratories, USA, a large generic Pharmaceutical Company. For his achievements, the state government has honoured him with the "Best Management Award" in 2006. On the other hand, in 2012, he was jailed during CBI's investigation on Y. S. Jaganmohan Reddy's Disproportionate Assets, for allegedly having paid Rs. 8.50 billion on a quid pro quo amounting to Rs 14261.7 million investments in VANPIC and other firms held by him, during Y. S. Rajasekhara Reddy's government. However, these assets were subsequently attached by the Enforcement Directorate of India, and Prasad was granted bail after seventeen months. Son of an army officer, Prasad obtained his BSc degree from Babu Jagjivanram Govt. College, Hyderabad, and then his MSc from the University of Delhi, followed by a post graduate diploma in management from Institute of Management Technology, Ghaziabad. Prasad started his career as a management trainee in Indian Molasses Company in Delhi (an associate of United Molasses Company, UK) in 1984 and was promoted to salesman at Rhone Poulenc Chemicals (the company later merged with Hoechst AG to form Aventis, and then to Vorin Laboratories as general manager of marketing in 1993, from his continuous efforts was elevated to managing director in 1995. When Indian pharma market leader Ranbaxy Ltd. acquired Vorin, Prasad was re-designated Senior managing director and chief executive officer. During this period, he also developed political connections, and was known to be close to Chief Ministers N. Chandrababu Naidu and Y.S. Rajasekhara Reddy. Subsequently, he developed a close friendship with Jaganmohan Reddy and served on the board of Sakshi and some other of Jagan's firms. In 2000, Prasad took over the sick pharmaceuticals company Herren Drugs, and renamed it Matrix Laboratories, and obtained US FDA clearance for the manufacturing facilities in Hyderabad. Matrix grew dramatically through a series of mergers and acquisitions. Prasad acquired Medicorp Technologies in May 2003, Vorin Labs in September 2003, Vera Laboratories, Fine Drugs & Chemicals the same year 2004 and a controlling stake in Concord Biotech in 2006. Prasad set his eyes on the global pharma-scape by acquiring Belgium-based Docpharma in June 2005, and a controlling stake in China's McChem Group. He also floated a JV South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare in September 2005, and picked 43% stake in Switzerland's Explora Laboratories SA the same year. In 2006, Prasad sold off his majority shares in Matrix to Mylan Laboratories, USA, a large generic Pharmaceutical Company. From an initial investment of Rs. 30 million, Prasad retained 5% in Matrix, and made about Rs. 5.70 billion in the transaction in which Mylan picked up a 71.5% stake in Matrix laboratories. Prasad implemented his belief that `the best way to enhance knowledge and wealth is to share it' by sharing his personal wealth of 20-lakh shares worth around Rs. 30 crore with his staff for their housing and children's education through the Matrix Employees Welfare Association (MEWA). He is known in the social world for his contribution through “Project Hope” in developing cost effective medicines for HIV/AIDS treatment. Matrix signed a major deal with the Clinton Foundation for the supply of anti-AIDS drugs as part of the latter's initiatives in Developing Countries. Pullela Gopichand's unwavering commitment that made his academy a powerhouse of badminton was backed and part funded by Prasad. In the early days when he was struggling to raise funds, Prasad saw the need to develop and encourage an alternative sport to Cricket and donated 5 Crores to the Pullela Gopichand academy. The academy produced world class players: Saina Nehwal, Srikanth Kidambi, Parupalli Kashyap, P. V. Sindhu, Arundhati Pantawane, Gurusai Datt and Arun Vishnu. Subsequently, Prasad invested his capital in healthcare – CARE hospitals and Asian Institute of Gastroenterology. He also invested in stent manufacturer Relisys, and some genomic research-based companies. In the media business, he invested in MAA TV. Prasad was on the Executive Board of the Indian School of Business (ISB), Hyderabad, besides his association with several academic, research and business organisations. After his arrests, he had to resign from most such posts such as the Indian School of Business. On 17 May 2012, Nimmagadda Prasad was questioned for several days and eventually arrested by the CBI. He was lodged in Chanchalguda jail, where he was always seen carrying a bottle of mineral water. After several failed attempts, he was eventually granted bail after seventeen months, in October 2013. In March 2014, in one of the largest criminal actions under the Prevention of Money Laundering Act, the Enforcement Directorate (ED) attached about 15 billion of assets of Nimmangada Prasad and his companies: G2 corporate Services Ltd, Alpha villas Pvt Ltd, Alpha Avenues Pvt Ltd, Gilchrist Investment Pvt Ltd, Suguni Constructions Pvt Ltd and Beta Avenues Pvt Ltd. ED claimed that Prasad had obtained illegal benefits of Rs 14261.7 million in his firms, and made the quid pro quo investment worth Rs 8545.4 million into Jagan Reddy's companies. On 22 Sep 2016, Bahamas papers revealed that he has 28 secret companies at Secundrabad. Prasad and Prakash Nimmagadda, with interests in real estate to pharmaceuticals, is another set of names. Prasad is already being probed by the Central Bureau of Investigation in another case, which had also arrested him in May 2012, and got bail 17 months later, the newspaper said. "I would not like to discuss this issue over phone. We can meet personally and talk about it. I will tell you everything," Prasad has been quoted as telling the Express. This was followed by calls by his office later canceling a total of three appointments that had been fixed, the Express said.

The Bangladesh cricket team was touring New Zealand for a single Test match, a three-match ODI series, and one Twenty20 International from 3 to 19 February 2010. This was 'The National Bank' Series. New Zealand started the series with a ten wicket victory in the Twenty20 International, dismissing Bangladesh for 78, the second lowest score by a full member of the International Cricket Council (ICC). New Zealand registered a clean sweep by winning the ODI series 3-0 and the Test series 1–0. 

Tirot Sing, also known as U Tirot Sing Syiem born in the year 1802 and died in the year 1835, was one of the chiefs of the Khasi people in the early 19th century. He drew his lineage from the Syiemlieh clan. He was Syiem (chief) of "Nongkhlaw", part of the Khasi Hills. His surname was "Syiem Lieh". He was a constitutional head sharing corporate authority with his Council, general representatives of the leading clans within his territory. Tirot Sing declared war and fought against British for attempts to take over control of the Khasi Hills. He died on 17 July 1835. His death is commemorated in Meghalaya as U Tirot Sing Day. The British had gained control over the Brahmaputra valley after concluding the Treaty of Yandabo in 1826. Between their possessions in Sylhet and the newly acquired possessions in Lower Assam intervened the Khasi Hills. They wanted to construct a road through this area to connect Guwahati with Sylhet to save weeks of travel and malarious country. David Scott, the agent to the British Governor-General for the Northern Territory, found out that U Tirot Sing was interested in regaining possessions in the "duars" (passes into Assam) in return for the permission for the road project. After a two-day session of the "durbar" (court), the assembly agreed to the proposal of the British. Work on the road started. When Balaram Singh, Raja of Ranee, disputed U Tirot Sing's claims to the duars, he went with a party of armed men in December 1828 to establish his claim. He was confident that the British would support him; instead, he was confronted by a party of sepoys who blocked his passage. When news came that the British were reinforcing forces in Assam, U Tirot Sing convened a Durbar again and passed orders for the British to evacuate Nongkhlaw. The British did not pay any heed, and the Khasis attacked the British garrison in Nongkhlaw on 4 April 1829. His men killed two British officers, and thus unleashed the fury of British retaliation. Military operations against U Tirot Sing and other Khasi chiefs started immediately. In the Anglo-Khasi War, the Khasis lacked firearms and had only swords, shields, bows and arrows. They were untrained in the British type of warfare and soon found that it was impossible to engage in open battle against an enemy who could kill from a distance. Therefore, they resorted to guerrilla activity, which dragged on for about four years. Tirot Sing fought with native weapons such as a sword and shield. He was shot at by the British and had to hide in a cave. He was eventually captured by the British in January 1833 and deported to Dhaka. The location of his hiding place was given by a chief of his who was bribed with gold coins by the British. He died on 17 July 1835. His death anniversary is commemorated every year as a state holiday in Meghalaya.

Women without Borders (WwB), an international non-profit organisation headquartered in Vienna and founded by Dr. Edit Schlaffer in 2001, works to empower women as agents of change. WwB has since its inception been putting research into practice through community-based strategies that combine theory and grassroots-level fieldwork. To date, WwB has conducted over 80 projects in some 30 countries with a focus on Female Leadership, Capacity Building, Gender Based Violence, Preventing Violent Extremism (PVE), and Empowering Dialogue. Responding to the growing threat of radicalisation by sensitising a hitherto neglected group to their roles and responsibilities in building community resilience from the ground up, WwB created the world's first female PVE platform: the Sisters Against Violent Extremism (SAVE) network. While addressing extremism is a priority among the range of distinct but interrelated WwB capacity building projects, this approach reflects WwB's longstanding, broader governing philosophy: translating research into action and empowering women to move from victimhood towards agency, the world over. In 2008, Women without Borders launched "SAVE" (Sisters Against Violent Extremism), the first women's counter-terrorism platform. The first conference took place from November 28-December 1, 2008 at Palais Schönburg in Vienna. Thirty-three survivors of terrorist attacks, relatives of victims and terrorists, activists, and policy makers were invited to discuss their experiences, strategize methods to combat violent extremism, and to create the "SAVE" declaration. "SAVE" campaigns include: "Schools/Students Against Violent Extremism!" and "Mothers for Change!" which attempt to provide constructive alternatives to the appeal of extremist ideologies. WwB started student groups under the "Students Against Violent Extremism" campaign in Delhi, Lucknow and Mumbai, conducting educational and interactive seminars attended by survivors of terrorist attacks for University and school children, with the aim of sensitizing them to the role they can play in combating extremism. "SAVE" is implementing similar projects with schools in Yemen and Indonesia. "Mothers For Change!" is "SAVE"'s most recent project, seeking to engage mothers in combating extremism and terrorism. Pilot research is underway on the project in Yemen and Saudi Arabia. In April 2010, "SAVE" conducted a workshop for the wives, daughters, sisters, and mothers of the police constables who protected lives during the 26/11 attacks, some of whom were killed while others were left severely disabled. Through storytelling workshops and swimming lessons, the women were encouraged to face and better cope with their traumatic experiences, while fostering a group sense of belonging. "SAVE" chapters have been started in India, Yemen, Northern Ireland, and the United Kingdom. Women without Borders began introducing the notion of Mothers Preventing Violent Extremism (MPVE) in the context of its SAVE network of projects and initiatives from 2008. Responding to its research study findings from surveys and interviews with 1023 mothers across five countries, WwB developed and designed the pioneering ‘MotherSchools: Parenting for Peace’ Model. When put into practice, this bottom-up prevention approach positions concerned and affected mothers as the first line of defence in at-risk communities. The curriculum strengthens the participant's individual capacity, capability, and emotional literacy, and heightens her awareness of radical influences. WwB has been advancing local and regional security through contextualised iterations of the programme, and to date has engaged over two thousand mothers in twelve countries across Western and Eastern Europe; Central, South, and Southeast Asia; the Middle East; and Sub-Saharan Africa. MotherSchools also upgrade existing social services and local capacity by providing civil society stakeholders in at-risk regions with the essential structures, tools, and skills to address and counteract extremist ideologies. Owing to its proven track record, WwB's MotherSchools Model has emerged as a recognised good practice and contributed to rethinking and reshaping countering and preventing violent extremism (P/CVE) policy worldwide. Since its inception, Women Without Borders has conducted a variety of projects in countries of crisis and transition, including Chennai in Southeast India, Zaranj, Turkey, Cyprus, and Austria. Women without Borders invited 18 women from Iraq, Afghanistan, Iran, South Africa, Israel, Palestine and Senegal to the first Women Without Borders conference in 2003. Since then, conferences organized by the NGO have been attended by government officials and high-level representatives of politics and civil society, including members of parliament and presidents of NGOs. In Afghanistan, in preparation for the 2004 Afghan elections, Women Without Borders created a handbook to encourage Afghan women to vote. With funding from the Austrian Research Fund, Women without Borders conducted a two-year “Bridging the Gap” study in Saudi Arabia. Women Without Borders surveyed 4,455 male and female students at King Saud University, King Abdul Aziz University, Qassim University, and King Faisal University to gather data on their views toward changing gender roles, future employment, and their health. Based on the findings, WwB developed workshops for female Saudi students. Women without Borders has also conducted projects against domestic violence. The campaign "Women Against Terror" gave women who have been severely beaten a platform to voice their personal views and perspectives. Women without Borders has conducted several sports-oriented projects, including: "Kicking for Reconciliation!" in Kigali, Rwanda, which used football as a tool to bring together Hutu and Tutsi girls to overcome trauma, hate and resentment. Women without Borders ran swimming lessons for women and girls in Chennai shortly after the tsunami to boost their chances of survival in the face of future events.

Hereafter is a 2010 American fantasy disaster drama film directed, co-produced, and scored by Clint Eastwood, written by Peter Morgan, and executive produced by Steven Spielberg. The film tells three parallel stories about three people affected by death in similar waysall three have issues of communicating with the dead; Matt Damon plays American factory worker George, who is able to communicate with the dead and who has worked professionally as a clairvoyant, but no longer wants to communicate with the dead; Cécile de France plays French television journalist Marie, who survives a near-death experience during the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami; and British schoolboy Marcus (played by Frankie and George McLaren), who loses the person closest to him. Bryce Dallas Howard, Lyndsey Marshal, Jay Mohr, and Thierry Neuvic have supporting roles. Morgan sold the script on spec to DreamWorks in 2008, but it transferred to Warner Bros. by the time Eastwood (who has a long-standing relationship with Warner Bros.) had signed on to direct in 2009. Principal photography ran from October 2009 to February 2010 on locations in London, San Francisco, Paris, and Hawaii. "Hereafter" premiered as a "Special Presentation" at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival on September 12, 2010. The film was given a limited release on October 15, 2010 and was released across North America on October 22, 2010. Although a box office success, the film received mixed reviews, with critics praising the plot and acting performances, while noting that the movie suffered from a lack of focus on the story. On assignment in India, French television journalist Marie Lelay is caught in the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Pulled lifeless from the water, she is resuscitated but left for dead. She gasps back to life after a near death experience, glimpsing a vision of the afterlife. Marie is reunited with her lover Didier as the disaster subsides, and they return to Paris. Marie's experience interferes with her work, and Didier, also her producer, sends her on a leave of absence. In San Francisco, George Lonegan reluctantly agrees to perform a psychic reading for Christos, a wealthy client of his brother Billy. An actual medium, George abandoned his career as a psychic due to the emotional, often disturbing impact of communicating with the dead. George asks if “June” means anything, which Christos denies; he reveals to Billy that June was his late wife's nurse, with whom he was in love. In London, 12-year-old twins Jason and Marcus try to prevent their alcoholic, heroin-addicted mother Jackie from losing them to social services. Evading the authorities, Jackie sends Jason to the chemist to pick up her detox prescription, having finally decided to get clean. Escaping from street thugs, Jason is hit by a van and killed. Unable to protect his mother or cope without his brother, Marcus is sent to a foster home. Marie travels to Switzerland to meet a hospice director, a former skeptic now convinced the afterlife exists. She persuades Marie to write a book on her experience, in hopes the scientific community will accept the reality of life beyond death. Desperate for a reunion with his brother, Marcus steals money from his foster parents and seeks help to contact Jason, but only encounters frauds. Boarding the London underground at Charing Cross, Jason's cap blows off Marcus’ head. Desperate to find it, Marcus misses his train, which explodes during the 2005 London Bombings. At a cooking class, George is partnered with Melanie. Hitting it off, they prepare dinner at George's home, and a phone message from Billy forces George to reveal his past as a psychic. Melanie persuades George to contact the spirit of her father, who asks forgiveness for what he did to her as a child. Melanie flees in tears, and does not return to the cooking class. Having been in talks with a publisher about a biography of François Mitterrand, Marie stuns them with her new manuscript: ""Hereafter: A Conspiracy of Silence"". The publisher rejects the work, but steers her toward another publisher in London. Marie learns Didier does not intend for her to return to her job, as her public interest in the hereafter has damaged her reputation, and he is having an affair with her replacement. Laid off from his factory job, George is persuaded by Billy to revive his psychic practice. Changing his mind, he impulsively travels to London, obsessively listening to Derek Jacobi’s audiobooks of Charles Dickens' works. He visits the Charles Dickens Museum and attends Jacobi's live reading at the London Book Fair, where Marie is reading her now published book, "Hereafter". When she hands George a signed copy, he has a psychic flash of her near-drowning. At the event with his foster parents, Marcus spots George, whom he has read about online. George brushes him off and returns to his hotel, but Marcus stands outside until George agrees to perform a reading. Through George, Jason tells Marcus he is happy in the afterlife, and that he knocked off his cap to save Marcus at the train station, and not to fear being alone "because we are one". With this closure, Marcus visits his mother, who is improving in a rehab center. George leaves an anonymous note for Marie that he believes her book to be true. She decides to join him for lunch; arriving at the café, George sees a vision of them kissing. With their shared glimpses of the hereafter having made them better appreciate life, George and Marie sit together. Peter Morgan wrote the script on spec, and it was bought by DreamWorks in March 2008. The deal was reportedly worth a "low-seven-figure advance". Executive producer Steven Spielberg was initially concerned that the low-key ending to the script would put audiences off the film, so Morgan rewrote it to be grander. However, subsequent drafts restored the original ending. Following its split from Paramount Pictures, DreamWorks retained the script, and began talks with Clint Eastwood to direct. Eastwood was signed on in November 2008. By the time of Matt Damon's casting in 2009, the script was being developed under the supervision of Eastwood's Malpaso Productions for Warner Bros.. Eastwood was attracted to the script because he was keen to direct a supernatural thriller, and liked how Morgan incorporated real-world events into fiction. Eastwood told "LA Weekly", "There's a certain charlatan aspect to the hereafter, to those who prey on people's beliefs that there's some afterlife, and mankind doesn't seem to be willing to accept that this is your life and you should do the best you can with it and enjoy it while you’re here, and that'll be enough. There has to be immortality or eternal life and embracing some religious thing. I don't have the answer. Maybe there is a hereafter, but I don't know, so I approach it by not knowing. I just tell the story." Production was based in the United Kingdom, due to tax incentives and funding from the UK Film Council, though filming locations spanned three countries. Filming commenced in France on October 19, 2009. A days filming was done at the old Belle Epoque, Le Grand Hôtel-Restaurant du Montenvers, in the village of Planet, near Chamonix. The hotel building was transformed into a Swiss hospice for scenes between Cécile de France and Marthe Keller. A cordon was set up around the area to prevent local residents and paparazzi taking photographs of the set, though the mayor of Chamonix was allowed through for a brief meeting with Eastwood. Production then moved to Paris for four days. On October 21, a short scene between de France and Mylène Jampanoï was filmed in a stairwell inside the France Télévisions building. In the first week of November, production moved to London for three weeks of filming in locations including Bermondsey and in Walworth. Scenes were also filmed on the Heygate Estate. On November 7, scenes were filmed in Petticoat Lane Market and at the Cafe Le Jardin in Bell Lane. Scenes were also filmed in an auditorium at Red Lion Square and at Camberwell New Cemetery. The room was redressed to represent a fictional Center For Psychic Advancement, which the Marcus character visits. De France filmed the underwater scene in a studio tank at Pinewood Studios. After these scenes were shot, production was halted, as Matt Damon was working on another film. Filming resumed on January 12, 2010; Eastwood filmed scenes with de France for three days on the Hawaiian island of Maui. On the first day, scenes were filmed in the lobby and guest rooms of the Sheraton Maui Resort & Spa in Kaanapali. On January 13, scenes were filmed on Front Street in Lahaina. A hundred crew worked on the scenes. The location managers were given permission by Lahaina authorities to close a small section of the street in order to film scenes depicting "an unnamed, South Pacific-type outdoor marketplace, complete with outdoor shopping stalls and street vendors". The location manager explained to the "Lahaina News", "Front Street's proximity to the water and the architecture of its buildings help supply a look that will require much less transformation towards this goal than other locations which were under consideration". The street was closed off to vehicles on the evening of January 12. The scene—the first scene of the film—depicts Cécile de France's character coming out of her hotel just as a tsunami hits the island. The aftermath of the tsunami was filmed on January 14 at a property in Kapalua. Production next moved to the San Francisco Bay Area. On January 19, scenes featuring Damon were shot at the California and Hawaiian Sugar Company refinery in Crockett, California, and the exterior of C&H Sugar is seen on screen. The location was not announced until filming had concluded, for fear that large crowds would gather to watch. Filming also took place in Nob Hill, San Francisco and Emeryville. While production was in the Bay Area, it employed 300 local extras and crew members. Production returned to London on January 29 to shoot Damon's final scenes. Later in the month, the London Book Fair was recreated inside the Alexandra Palace for a scene featuring George and Marie. Publishers including Random House had their stands built for the three-day shoot, two months before the real London Book Fair took place. Filming wrapped afterwards. Visual effects work was carried out by Los Angeles-based Scanline VFX. 169 effects were created, the key sequence of which was the tsunami, which features "full CG water shots and CG water extensions to water plates, digital doubles, CG set extensions, matte paintings, digital make-up fx and full CG environments with extensive destruction, from toppling digital palm trees to colliding digital cars". An effect described as the "hereafter effect" also appears, "[giving] the viewer glimpses into the afterlife". After initial speculation by "Variety" that the film would be released in December 2010, Warner Bros. announced that "Hereafter" would go on general release in the United States and Canada on October 22, 2010. A pre-release screening of "Hereafter" was held on August 10, 2010. The film had its world premiere on September 12, 2010 at the 2010 Toronto International Film Festival. The theatrical trailer was attached to "The Town" and "Life as We Know It". "Hereafter" was also screened on October 10, 2010 as the Closing Night Film of the 48th New York Film Festival. The film was given a limited release on October 15, 2010. The film premiered in Japan on February 19, 2011. A few days after the 11 March 2011 earthquake and tsunami in Japan, the film was withdrawn from all cinemas in that country, two weeks earlier than originally planned. "Warner Bros. spokesperson Satoru Otani said the film's terrifying tsunami scenes were 'not appropriate' at this time." "Hereafter" has received mixed reviews from critics. Review aggregate Rotten Tomatoes reports that 47% of critics have given the film a positive review based on 234 reviews, with an average score of 5.73/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "Despite a thought-provoking premise and Clint Eastwood's typical flair as director, "Hereafter" fails to generate much compelling drama, straddling the line between poignant sentimentality and hokey tedium." Metacritic, another review aggregator, assigned the film a weighted average score of 56/100 based on 41 reviews. Roger Ebert, however, gave the film four stars (out of four), calling it a film that "considers the idea of an afterlife with tenderness, beauty and a gentle tact. I was surprised to find it enthralling." The film received a nomination for the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects, but lost to another Warner Bros. film, "Inception". It won the Visual Effects Society Award for Outstanding Supporting Visual Effects in a Feature Motion Picture and was also nominated in the category of Outstanding Compositing in a Feature Motion Picture. 

HMS "Rosario" was an 11-gun screw sloop of the Royal Navy, launched in 1860 at Deptford Dockyard. She served two commissions, including eight years on the Australia Station during which she fought to reduce illegal kidnappings of South Sea Islanders for the Queensland labour market. She was decommissioned in 1875, finally being sold for breaking nine years later. A team from "Rosario" played the first ever New Zealand International Rugby Union match against a Wellington side in 1870. She was the fifth Royal Navy ship to bear the name, which was first used for the galleon "Del Rosario", captured from the Spanish in 1588. The "Rosario" class was designed in 1858 by Issac Watts, the Director of Naval Construction. They were built of wood, were rated for 11 guns and were built with a full ship rig of sails (this was reduced to a barque rig by about 1869). With a length overall of and a beam of , they had a displacement of 913 tonnes. These were the last sloops constructed for the Royal Navy to retain all-wooden construction; their successors, the "Amazon" class, incorporated iron cross beams. "Rosario" was fitted with a Greenock Foundry Company two-cylinder horizontal single-expansion steam engine driving a single screw. With an indicated horsepower of she was capable of under steam. As designed, ships of the class carried a single slide-mounted 40-pounder Armstrong breech-loading gun, six 32-pounder muzzle-loading smooth-bore guns and four pivot-mounted 20-pounder Armstrong breech loaders. By 1869 the armament had been reduced to a single muzzle-loading gun and two 40-pounders. "Rosario" was ordered from Deptford Dockyard on 1 April 1857 and laid down on 13 June 1859. She was the first of her class to be launched, on 17 October 1860 and she was commissioned under Commander James Stanley Graham on 20 June 1862 From June to October 1862 she was employed in fishery protection duties in the North Sea. In October, she was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station, and cases of fever and smallpox were recorded in her in 1864 after visits to Kingston, Jamaica and Fort Monroe in Virginia. The strained relationship between the Union and Britain during the American Civil War did not prevent visits to American ports, but ships of the North America Station would also have used Bermuda and the Royal Naval Dockyard, Halifax as bases. The Lyons–Seward Treaty of 1862 allowed for greater co-operation between the US Navy and the Royal Navy in combating slavery, and it is probable that anti-slavery formed part of her employment, particularly in the Caribbean. In 1866, she was ordered from Quebec to Montreal to provide protection to the harbour during the Fenian Raid of 1866. Sixteen members of her ship's company were awarded the "Fenian Raid 1866" clasp to the Canada General Service Medal 1866-70, possibly while serving as members of a Naval Brigade. After four years on the North America and West Indies Station she paid off at Chatham on 13 October 1866. "Rosario" recommissioned at Woolwich on 28 September 1867 under her previous captain, Commander Louis Venturne. Commander George Palmer then took command in October 1867 and under him she sailed for the Australia Station. On 4 June 1868, officers from HMS "Rosario" were entertained in Auckland, New Zealand by the Officers of the Royal Irish Regiment (the 18th). On 5 June the ship left Auckland for Tauranga, with the Governor of New Zealand, Sir George F. Bowen on board. In 1869 "Rosario" detained the schooner on suspicion of "blackbirding", or the illegal recruitment (including enslavement) of the indigenous populations of nearby Pacific islands or northern Queensland. Commander Palmer brought charges at the Vice Admiralty Court of New South Wales, but the charges were dismissed by the Chief Justice of New South Wales, Sir Alfred Stephen, on the grounds that the British Slave Trade Act 1839 did not apply to the South Pacific Ocean. In 1870 a team from "Rosario" played the first New Zealand International Rugby Union match against a side from Wellington. It was intended to recommission her in Sydney in 1871, with a new crew being brought out from England in , but with Commander Challis remaining in command. In the event "Megaera" became a total loss at the isolated St Paul Island, and her passengers were rescued by and SS "Malacca". There were no fatalities, and the new crews eventually reached their intended ships. Albert Hastings Markham became acting commander of "Rosario" between October 1871 and 10 February 1872, during a voyage to the New Hebrides for the suppression of the South Seas labour trade. He published an account of the cruise under the title "The cruise of the "Rosario" amongst the New Hebrides and Santa Cruz Islands, exposing the recent atrocities connected with the kidnapping of natives in the South Seas." The cruise included a visit to the island of Nukapu to inquire into the murder of Bishop Patteson, but little of value was found until they came to the south-east side of the Island, where the bishop had been killed. In the words of the contemporary newspaper report: The ill feeling against white men in Nukapu is easily understood; one of the vessels stopped by "Rosario" during the November 1871 cruise was the brig "Carl", which had been the scene of a particularly brutal massacre. Markham was too late to find any evidence of the murder of up to 50 islanders on board (that came later when one of the crew turned King's evidence), but the activities of the ship in the area explain the aggressive attacks of the local population, and probably also explain the murder of the bishop. The measures taken by "Rosario" became the subject of questions in the House of Commons, and Markham's book on the subject may well have been prompted by them. The book itself makes clear that Markham clearly understood the cycle of violence and deplored both the murderous activities of the Blackbirders, and the apparent need for further violence in restoring order. In April 1872, once again under Commander Challis, she visited Wellington, Otago and Auckland in New Zealand. Her cruise of the later part of the year took her to the Solomon Islands, and was conducted entirely under canvas. The summer of 1874 was spent visiting Fiji, the Marshall Islands, the Ellice Islands and the Gilbert Islands, in part searching for William "Bully" Hayes, who was notorious for his blackbirding activities. "Rosario" picked up a number of his shipwrecked crew from Kosrae, but Hayes evaded the search. In 1874, she was employed as a prison hulk for young criminals, and on 12 October 1875 "Rosario" paid off at Sheerness after an eight-year commission. She is listed at Chatham in 1880, and on 31 January 1884 she was sold to Castle for breaking up at Charlton. 

It was typical at this time for Ryukyuan aristocrats to have multiple names. Chōjō held the title of "ueekata" of the domain of Kōchi, and was thus known as "Kōchi ueekata". He was also known as . Details of his early life are unknown. In 1876, however, Chōjō left for China from Unten Harbor on the Motobu Peninsula, in the north of Okinawa Island, claiming he was simply crossing over to nearby Iejima. Arriving in China, he adopted Chinese (Manchu) hairstyle and dress and, with the Ryūkyū-kan in Fuzhou as his base, he began traveling to various parts, seeking support for his cause: to convince the Qing government to aid Ryūkyū in remaining independent from Japan. Chōjō gathered other Ryukyuans who, like himself, had fled for China, including Rin Seikō (林世功) and Sai Taitei (蔡大鼎). Together, they submitted numerous petitions to the Qing officials asking for help on behalf of the kingdom. Though there was little, if any, positive response for a long time, Chōjō and others refused to give up. He died in Fukien Province.

Bunbury Catholic College is a Catholic secondary school, located in Bunbury, in the South West region of Western Australia. The College was formed in 1973 after the amalgamation of St Francis Xavier's College (operated by the Marist Brothers) and St Joseph's College (operated by the Sisters of Mercy) and provides a general and religious education for approximately 1,000 students from Year 7 to Year 12. In 1973 the Bishop of Bunbury mandated the administration of systemic Bunbury Catholic College to the Catholic Education Commission. The college developed from the amalgamation of St Francis Xavier College (Marist Brothers) and St Joseph’s School (Mercy Sisters). The Commission fosters the continuous development and improvement of Catholic schools, acts on behalf of the Catholic community and determines major policy. In 2015, a second campus was built in the nearby suburb of Australind; commonly known as the Mercy campus. The campus name is derived from the Sisters of Mercy, who co-founded the school. The Mercy Campus became independent in 2020, and split to form Our Lady of Mercy College. 

Erebus superba is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Charles Swinhoe in 1908. It is found in the Indian state of Meghalaya and in Nepal. 

Optical bonding refers to a protective glass that is glued in front of a display to enhance its readability where installed in high humidity outdoor environments. When a normal display is used in an outdoor environment, there are some factors that affect its readability. The most common one is “fog”, or condensation, which forms on the inner surface of display's vandal shield. Another factor is the reflection of sunlight, which causes a mirror-image on the display. Both phenomena can be solved by using optical bonding. There are a wide variety of adhesives used for optical bonding processes. Three of the most commonly used are silicone, epoxy, and polyurethane. Below are overviews of the pros/cons of each adhesive type. Optical bonding is the use of an optical-grade adhesive to glue a glass to the top surface of a display. The main goal of optical bonding is to improve the display performance under outdoor environments. This method eliminates the air gap between the cover glass and the display. Moreover, anti-reflective coating is often used in optical bonding glass. The real problem for display readability in outdoor environments is not the display's brightness but its contrast. Contrast means the ratio of the white level to the black level; in other words, the contrast ratio of display means the difference of light intensity between the brightest white pixel and the darkest black pixel. The main purpose of optical bonding is to increase the display's contrast ratio by reducing the amount of reflected ambient light. Optical bonding, we call full-lamination which can be used for touch lamination/integration, bonded touch to lcd module

Sandouping () is a town in Yiling District of Yichang prefecture-level city in the Chinese province of Hubei. It is located on the right (southern) bank of the Yangtze River, next to Yiling District's border with Zigui County to the west. Sandouping is best known as the location of the Three Gorges Dam, which is the world's largest electricity-generating plant of any kind. The predecessor of today's Sandouping, the village of Huangniupu (黄牛铺, "Yellow Cow Post Station") was established during the reign of the Hongzhi Emperor in 1496. Sandouping District was created in March 1949 and transformed into Sandouping Town in February 1984. Sandouping used to be a small fishing village until it was selected to be the site of the Three Gorges Dam. In 1999, at the peak of the construction, over 40,000 workers lived in Sandouping. At the time, special permits were required to enter the town. Six out of nineteen Sandouping's villages are populated by families that have been resettled from the areas flooded by the waters of the Three Gorges Reservoir, or, earlier, the Gezhouba Reservoir. The Town of Sandouping occupies 178 km on the right (southern) bank of the Yangtze River, opposite the town of Letianxi (), to which it is connected by Xiling Bridge. Sandouping is the only town in Yiling District that is located south of the river. Sandouping's western neighbor is the town of Maoping, the county seat of the nearby Zigui County. Although it is only a kilometer or two west of the dam (straight-line distance), it is actually several kilometers drive on Hubei Provincial Route 134, because of the terrain. Administratively, the Town of Sandouping is divided into 19 villages () and 1 neighborhood committee (). Sandouping's central urban area, where the town government and most services are located, is technically known as Yuanyi Village (). It is situated some 5 km east of the southern end of the Three Gorges Dam. The neighborhood just to the east, known as Huanglingmiao Village (), is named after Huangling Temple () located there near the Yangtze River waterfront. It is being developed as a tourism area, centered around the riverboat dock. A secondary center of economic activity in the town is located in its western part, within walking distance from the service entrance to the Three Gorges Dam (Gaojiachong Village () and Sandouping residential community). One residential community: Nineteen villages: The town's economy is closely connected to the Yangtze River. Besides the Three Gorges Dam, major local enterprises include Hailun Shipyard () and Fazhong Vessel Servicing Company (). The three main agricultural products of Sandouping are citrus fruits (according to different governmental sources, 15,000 "mu" [ 1,000 hectares] or 10535 mu [702 ha] under cultivation, with an annual harvest of 14,000 metric tons), silkworms (14400 "mu"/ 960 ha of mulberry plantations), and tea (3316 "mu"/ 221 ha). The town's authorities are working on expanding tourism in the area. 

Eglinton Square Shopping Centre is an enclosed shopping mall in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, located at Eglinton Avenue East and Victoria Park Avenue in Scarborough's Golden Mile neighbourhood. It opened in 1954 as a strip plaza, like most retail space at the time, and was later converted to mall. It was notable for having a parking garage attached to Morgans department store, with a steep winding ramp. Morgan's was bought by the Hudson's Bay Company and eventually became a Bay. The garage was demolished. The main shopping centre still has two 1960s style ramps that provide two levels of parking on top of the stores. The top most level is the roof of the building and also provides open air parking spaces. It is owned by Kingsett Capital and under the management of Bentall Kennedy (Canada) LP. It has approximately of retail space with over 80 retail outlets. The mall is located on what was once the site of James Neilson's farm. The shopping centre is slated for major redevelopment, with high density condo buildings as part of the mix, due to the Eglinton Crosstown LRT that is being built along Eglinton Avenue. The mall was opened to the public in 1954 in an area once settled by farmland in the 1820s and re-developed as industrial land during World War II along Eglinton Avenue and surrounded by residential homes to the north, south and west sides. 

Vourukasha is the name of a heavenly sea in Zoroastrian mythology. It was created by Ahura Mazda and in its middle stood the "Harvisptokhm" or the "tree of all seeds". According to the Vendidad, Ahura Mazda sent the clean waters of Vourukasha down to the earth in order to cleanse the world and sent the water back to the heavenly sea "Puitika". This phenomenon was later interpreted as the coming and going of the tide. At the centre of Vourukasha was located the Harvisptokhm or "tree of all seeds" which contain the seeds of all plants in the world. There is a bird Sinamru on the tree which causes the bough to break and seeds to sprinkle all around when it alights. At the center of the Vourukasha also grows the "Gaokerena" or "White Haoma", considered to be the "king of healing plants". It is surrounded by ten thousand other healing plants. In later times, Vourukasha was connected with the Persian Sea and the "Puitika" with the Gulf of Oman.

62 Cavalry was a pioneering component of the armoured corps of India. Its raising as the first armoured regiment of an independent nation merged the flair of Risala with the vision of an emergent army. The regiment was exemplified in an array of regimental insignia and colours that were a break from the usual pennants and lances, and reflected the efforts put into their design and conception. The 62nd Cavalry is an armoured regiment of the Indian Army and was raised by Lt Col RS Butalia on 31 Mar 1957 at Ambala cantonment. Drawn from the existing cavalry regiments of the time, the 62nd Cavalry was recruited from Sikh, Jat and Dogra communities. Regimental Crest.  The five pointed star is the symbol of the Lord creator, in the sense that it represents the five basic elements of creation: earth, air, fire, water and ether. The twelve pointed chakra may be linked to the symbol of Lord Krishna’s Sudarshan Chakra. It can also be taken as a twelve pointed lotus, the symbol of lord Shiva in his benign form. Both the forms are very dear to the Jats and the Dogras. The inner chakra symbolizes the guru’s grace in battle, so near and dear to the Sikhs, whereas, the five pointed star, twelve pointed Chakra and the plain Chakra all symbolize faith in god and his protection to the wearer of the badge. The mace-head symbolizes the yama or Kal (Pran Nath) or Shiva as the destroyer of the enemy and evil. In its modern connotation the badge consists of a sprocket, conveying mobility in battle, and a mace-head that represents the destruction of the enemy through firepower. The regiment was born as the first armoured regiment to be raised in independent India and was the first Indian armoured regiment to be raised entirely on tanks. In its ninth year, the 62nd Cavalry took part in the 1965 War against Pakistan. The regiment, equipped with obsolete Sherman tanks fought modern Pakistani Patton tanks and outgunned and out-tanked them. The regiment was honoured by President Neelam Sanjiva Reddy during its silver jubilee when he presented a Guidon to them on 31 March 1981. Regiment Colours. The colours of the regiment are azure blue and canary yellow. The yellow signifies the divine light (jyoti) and blue stands for purity of action (or mind) a colour that is dear to both Lord Krishna and Guru Gobind Singh. It is also the colour of Vayu and of Lord Shiva. Regimental Motto.  After research on ,regimental Crest and colours, the regiment motto was selected. It was a follow up to the sentiments behind the crest and the colours. The founders of the regiment selected ‘Dhairya evm Shaurya’ as the motto which signifies ‘With Faith in God, Fight with Valour' or 'Fortitude & Valour’.  Thus the interpretation is ‘having surrendered to the will of god, fight with courage’. Lieutenant Colonel RS Butalia, first Commandant of the Regiment, played an instrumental role in selection of the motto, which reflects the blend of military and religious convictions, thus reinforcing the belief that victory has always been the privilege of the brave and the righteous. First Armoured Regiment to be raised entirely on tanks – July 1956 First Armoured Regiment to be raised post-independence – June 1956 First Regiment to innovate navigation on gyro – April 1977 First CG (MIKE Force) of Indian Army – December 1971 First T-72 Regiment to be inducted across River Chenab – 2011 First Regiment to take T-72 on Zozilla top and across to Leh – 2011 First Regiment to fire utilising Cdr’s TI sight – 2019 Fd Marshal Visiting the Regiment Gen Bewoor Visiting the Regiment This is a brief account of the operations carried out by 62 Cavalry against Pakistan in Sialkot Sector from 05 to 23 September 1965. The 62 Cavalry was operationally deployed for the first time during Operation Ablaze in April 1965.  It provided the regiment an experience of preparations of war. A few exercises with troops with full strength were also conducted during May and June 1965, which came handy subsequently during operations later on. In early September 1965, the stage was set for operations into Pakistan and additional formations including HQ 1 Corps moved into Jammu and Kashmir. On 6 September 1965, 62 Cavalry was placed under command 6 Mountain Division for operations across Indo-Pakistan border. At an ‘order’ group conference held at Headquarters 6 Mountain Division, attended by the commandant, Lieutenant Colonel BM Singh the plan of attack finalised was as under: (a)       99 Mountain Brigade with ‘B’ Squadron 62 Cavalry to capture Charwa. (b)       69 Mountain Brigade with ‘A’ Squadron 62 Cavalry to capture Maharajke. (c)        ‘C’ Squadron 62 Cavalry to protect the left flank of 1 Armoured Division during its advance onto Phillora. (d)       Charwa and Maharajke to be secured by 0500 Hours on 08 September 1965. (e)       43 Lorried Brigade Group to advance after capture of Charwa, to Koga-Likoke. (f)        62 Cavalry less ‘C’ Squadron subsequently to come under command 43 Lorried Brigade at 0900 Hours on 08 September 1965 for advance to Koga - Likoke. The commandant at 1100 hours same day, issued final orders and action was completed by all concerned to get tanks and administrative echelons ready with full battle loads. The regiment moved from its permanent location to Chatta near Jammu at 2000 Hours on 6 September 1965 on tracks, a distance of 20 miles on indifferent roads along with hundreds of B vehicles of infantry moving to forward concentration by 2300 hours as under:            62 CAVALRY less ‘A’ Squadron in area Iron Bridge.          ‘A’ Squadron in area Noria. The following officers and JCOs moved to the concentration area:-            Regiment Headquarters                        Lieutenant Colonel BM Singh      -           Commandant.                        Major BK Mukherjee                        -           Second-in-Command.                        Captain J Baskaran                         -           Adjutant.                        Captain GN Yedur, AMC                -           Regiment Medical Officer. Lieutenant CS Brar.                         -           Intelligence Officer.            ‘A’ Squadron.                        Major BIS Khurana                          -           Squadron Commander.                        Lieutenant Heminder Singh.                        Lieutenant NG Datta.                        Second Lieutenant PK Langar.                        Risaldar Mukhtiar Singh.                        JC-16039 Naib Risaldar Santokh Singh.                        JC-24930 Naib Risaldar Santokh Singh.            ‘B’ Squadron.                        Major KMKS Barach.                       -           Squadron Commander.                        Captain Kulwant Singh.                        Captain Achu Nair.                        Second Lieutenant SW Barnabas.                        Risaldar Fateh Singh.                        Naib Risaldar Sham Lal.                        Naib Risaldar Sultan Singh.             ‘C’ Squadron.                     Major SS Kirtane                              -           Squadron Commander.                      Captain DPN Singh.                     Risaldar Lekh Raj.                       Risaldar Inder Singh.                       Naib Risaldar Prem Singh. On 7 September 1965, whilst in forward concentration area at about 0730 hours, four Pakistani F-86 Sabre Jets strafed and rocketed the regiment.  However, due to good concealment and dispersal, it suffered no casualties. During whole of 7 September 1965, the regiment prepared itself for the attack.  After the regimental order group where details of impending attacks on Charwa and Maharajke were given out, the squadron commanders attended the order groups at respective brigade headquarters and limited marrying up with infantry units was carried out. The commandant addressed all ranks and exhorted them to trust in God and carryout the assigned tasks boldly and fearlessly. Own guns opened up at 2300 hours on 7 September and 99 Mountain Brigade crossed SL at 2330 hours.  Regiment headquarters and ‘B’ Squadron moved out to join 99 Mountain Brigade to provide anti-tank protection in the Charwa bridgehead.  Due to difficult going a few tanks could not keep pace with leading elements; thus initially two troops of ‘B’ Squadron reached Charwa at 0500 hours and remainder of ‘B’ Squadron and regiment headquarter arrived at 0730 hours. Although the main enemy position at Charwa was captured by 0500 hours but small parties still held out in surrounding sugarcane fields. Later, ‘B’ Squadron with a company of 2/5 Gorkha Rifle, combed the area 2000 yards south and southwest of Charwa. Maharajke, a nodal point on road Zafarwal - Sialkot put up a stiff resistance. 69 Mountain Brigade with ‘A’ Squadron captured it by 0530 hours in spite of heavy casualties. During early stages of battle, when communications were disrupted due to enemy action, Naib Risaldar Santokh Singh (JC-16039) carried the brigade commander in his tank to forward localities.  Meanwhile, Lance Dafadar Santokh Singh (who was later killed in a tank battle near Pagowal) charged with his tank on enemy RCL gun which was engaging tanks and overran it. At about 1500 hours on 08 September 1965, Commander 43 Lorried Infantry Brigade ordered the regiment headquarter and ‘B’ Squadron to resume their advance from Charwa and clear the area between Charwa and Maharajke.  Small pockets of Pakistani fighters still held at Khanor and Sangial, and fired automatic weapons on tank commanders who were moving with hatches open. Near Sangial, a party of armed mujahids firing from high ground was effectively engaged by Commandant and Adjutant (Captain J Bhaskaran) themselves taking a shoot. At about 1730 hours 4 Pakistani F-86 Sabre Jets strafed and rocketed the column and at 1830 Hours it reached Maharajke.  A1 & A2 echelons joined the Regiment at Maharajke.  While in harbour, the regiment at night was fired upon by enemy small parties using MMGs. Due to bad going, advance of 43 Lorried Brigade had been slowed down and it completed concentration in Maharajke during night 8/9 September 1965.  At an order group held at headquarters 43 Lorried Brigade at 2330 Hours, the regiment was ordered to advance next morning and secure Pagowal.  Following additional troops were placed under command: Under Command – 8 Garhwal Rifles Indirect Support – R Battery 101 Field Regiment (SP) At 0915 hours advance commenced and ‘A’ Squadron secured first bound Parashayan.  Thereafter, the advance continued with ‘B’ Squadron leading and area Kaloi was secured by 1400 hours after brushing aside minor opposition in the villages.  At about 1445 Hours, Commander 43 Lorried Brigade ordered the regiment to firm in area Kaloi.  43 Lorried Brigade occupied a defended sector in area Kaloi–Rurki Khurd and the regiment was deployed to provide anti-tank defense to the brigade defended Sector.  At about 1100 hours on 10 September 1965, Pakistani fighters brought down a heavy concentration of medium artillery fire on the defended sector and No 1034723 Sowar Sher Singh became the first battle casualty. Task On 11 September 1965, 62 Cavalry, less ‘C’ Squadron, was located at Kaloi. At a briefing by the commandant; general officer commanding, 1 Armoured Division, tasked the regiment “To secure the important area crossroads, so as to protect the western area flank of 1 Armoured Brigade attack on Phillora”. Enemy Dispositions Intelligence sources believed that little, if any, Pakistani armour was in the area Pagowal - Wadianwala. It was felt, that they had either already moved their armour further east to block the advance of 1 Armoured Brigade onto Phillora or were holding it in reserve for defense of Sialkot. Advance to Cross-Roads The regiment advanced at 0930 Hours from Kaloi along track Kaloi - Haral - Pagowal crossroads.  The village Haral was secured by 1110 h,ours.  As leading troops advanced further skirting village Pagowal, about 1500 yards from the objective, Pakistani Patton tanks located in a grove near Pagowal opened fire on the leading tanks. The leading squadron was ordered to deploy in the area Lone Tree - Haral to engage enemy armour frontally.  The other squadron was to move up West of Haral, to take on enemy armour from that flank. Two troops of Patton tanks located in the grove were engaged and soon after were hit and set on fire. The remainder pulled back behind village Pagowal. The squadron was to keep edging forward towards cross roads, but ensuring that two troops, constantly kept a watch on enemy armour which was still in that area. Meanwhile, Pakistani artillery observation posts apparently located on top of houses in village Pagowal, which in itself was on a rise, brought down intense medium artillery fire on the leading troops of both squadrons, which were in their full view and further advance was held up. Enemy Counter Attack Soon after a big cloud of dust was seen approaching Pagowal from the southwest.  It appeared enemy was fast moving armour reinforcements from Wadianwala-Chak Lwaranda to block further advance. The Pakistani reaction to the regiment’s advance to area Pagowal was because it was the deepest thrust made till then towards Sialkot; and moreover threatened to cut off their forces still fighting in Phillora. Thereafter, two squadrons of Pakistani Patton tanks supported by heavy artillery fire made an aggressive thrust to envelop the regiment around village Haral. When this thrust was held, enemy developed two parallel thrusts with a squadron each moving to the west and east of Haral aimed at cutting off communications with Brigade Defended Sector at Kaloi or possibly to drive a deep wedge towards Maharajke which then was then lightly undefended.  Both the regiment’s flanks were vulnerable; 168 Brigade was still at Bajragarhi and 1 Armoured Brigade was fighting in area Libbe - Phillora. Own Plan The Commandant quickly evolved a plan, which called for holding a number of layback positions and time till each one was to be denied to the enemy.  Due to the Pakistani's qualitative superiority in armour, it was vital that one squadron should hold the enemy to gain time for second squadron to move to the next layback position and settle before contact; as in a running fight Sherman tanks would likely have fared badly against Pattons. The regiment headquarter remained with each squadron as it held layback position, from where it could watch the progress of the Pakistani outflanking moves, and thus was able to control and direct the early move of troops to thwart their aim. By late afternoon, the fighting had lasted over six hours and though three Patton tanks had been knocked out and several more damaged, five Sherman tanks on the Indian side had been destroyed. Further, the tanks had almost exhausted their ammunition.  However, by then, on the Commandant’s incessant requests to General Officer Commanding, 1 Armoured Division, a medium artillery regiment was allocated for support and this greatly helped slow down the Pakistani enemy advance. Meanwhile officers and men collected ammunition from A1 echelon and fed it to leading tanks in open jeeps, at times under enemy artillery fire.  Finally, the Pakistani armour was halted on line Ring Contour - Ghaon - Grave Yard and the Regiment held area Kaloi - Chak Ali to block their passage to Maharajke or its interference with Brigade Defended Sector at Kaloi. 1 Armoured Division account of operations for 11 September 1965 reads:- “62 Cavalry less one squadron with 8 Garhwal Rifles were ordered to establish themselves in area GAT to ensure that no enemy armour broke through our Right flank from Sialkot side.  At about 1530 hours, the enemy launched a furious attack with a regiment of Patton tanks directed against our right flank troops established in GAT.  The enemy’s intention was to cut off our rear, a sensitive spot in so far as it affected the overall day’s battle”. Even though the crossroads was not captured, bby drawing away and fighting to a standstill a major enemy armour force throughout that day, the overall aim was fully achieved, as it helped to safeguard West flank of 1 Armoured Brigade which captured Phillora at 1600 hours, on 11 September 1965. After Pagowal was captured on 13 September 1965 by 69 Mountain Brigade and 62 Cavalry, the sight of a large number of tank tracks in Wadianwala – Chak Lwaranda area confirmed the earlier estimate that on 11 September 1965 almost a Patton regiment had fought against 62 Cavalry. This tank battle was the climax of the battle till then which resulted in knocking out of three Patton tanks, two of which remained on the ground near Pagowal till 24 February 1966. 

Josef Danhauser (August 19, 1805 in Laimgrube (now a part of Mariahilf or Neubau) – May 4, 1845) was an Austrian painter, one of the main artists of Biedermeier period, together with Ferdinand Georg Waldmüller, Peter Fendi, among others. His works, not very appreciated in his days, dealt with very moralising subjects and had a clear influence of William Hogarth. Joseph Danhauser was born in Vienna in 1805, the eldest son of sculptor and furniture manufacturer Joseph Ulrich Danhauser and his wife Johanna ("née" Lambert). He took his first painting lessons with his father and later assisted the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts. He studied with Johann Peter Krafft and made his first exhibition 1826. Invited by Johann Ladislaus Pyrker, patriarch of Venice, he visited the city of Doges, where he started to study the Italian masters. He came back to Vienna via Trieste in 1827, visiting Prague. On March 27, 1827 he and his colleague molded Ludwig van Beethoven's death mask, roughly 12 hours after his death and Danhauser painted a water-colour representing his deathbed. In 1828, he spent some time in Eger, with an invitation of this Hungarian city archbishop Pyrker. He solicited him for some pictures for the gallery of the Archdiocese. After his father's death in 1829, his brothers and he managed his furniture factory during the Biedermeier movement, being the precursors of modern design. That made him put his painting career aside. In 1833, he responded to a second invitation from Eger's archbishop and he painted "The martyr of Saint John" for a new basilica in the city and he received the Vienna Academy prize for his picture "Die Verstoßung der Hagar" and he specialised in Genre works. In 1838, he was appointed vice-rector of the Academy and married Josephine Streit, who was the daughter of a physician and with whom he had three children, Josef, Marie and Julie, born in 1839, 1841 and 1843 respectively. Josef Danhauser was appointed professor of historical Painting at the Academy in 1841, but he left this occupation and he travelled around Germany and the Netherlands with the textile maker, art aficionado and art sponsor Rudolf von Arthaber. In this journey, he was very interested in the Dutch School and the format of his works was smaller. He died of typhus in Vienna in 1845 and was buried in Hundstrumer Cemetery, though his grave was later moved. In 1862, a street was named after him in Vienna. "(dimensions given in metres)"

Hammerfest is a music festival held annually in North Wales. From 2013, Hammerfest has moved to the Haven site in Pwllheli, Hafan y Môr Holiday Park as the festival has outgrown its original site at Pontin's Holiday Village, Prestatyn, Wales. It is not related to a music festival of the same name hosted by white supremacist groups. The festival is owned by emc3i Ltd, sponsored by the music magazine Metal Hammer and run by the organizers of the Hard Rock Hell festival. Because the festival is held at a holiday camp, the organizers can make use of pre-built venues and stages, and attendees can stay in the on-site accommodation. This enables the festival to be held during the winter/spring months when outdoor camping is not desirable. The original Hammerfest was held on 24–25 April 2009 in Prestatyn. Fifty bands appeared at the festival spread over three stages and across the two days. Saxon, Sepultura and Opeth headlined the two-day event. The second Hammerfest was held on 12–13 March 2010, with a pre-party on the preceding Thursday. 44 bands performed across three stages during the two-day festival, with an additional 8 bands performing on the second and third stages during the Thursday pre-party. The festival was headlined by 5 Finger Death Punch and Suicidal Tendencies. The third Hammerfest was held on 18–19 March 2011. A pre-party was held on the preceding Thursday as in the previous year, with bands performing on the second and third stages. 48 bands performed across three stages during the two-day festival, with an additional 11 bands performing during the Thursday pre-party. Accept and Sabaton were the headline acts. Four months before the festival, Pontin's (who own the venue) went into administration. However, the festival still took place as scheduled. Hammerfest returned for a fourth edition of the festival on 15–18 March 2012. Anthrax and Skindred were the headline acts on the main stage. The format was the same as previous years with the pre-party beginning on the Thursday night. In Total, 57 bands played across the three stages. Tickets for next year's Hammerfest 5 went on sale during the festival which promises to be bigger than ever at the new site. The fifth installment took place between the 14 and 16 March 2013. The pre-party night took place on the 14th with bands playing on the second stage. Hammerfest 5 saw the introduction of an unplugged stage on the Friday but in general only two stages were used. The event was moved to Hafan Y Mor in Pwllheli. Hammerfest VI ("Book of the Dead") was in Pwllheli from 13 March to 16 March 2014. Hammerfest VII, titled "METAL MARAUDERS" was held from 12 March to 15 March 2015. 

Catocala umbrosa is a moth of the family Erebidae first described by Vernon Antoine Brou Jr. in 2002. It is found from Missouri and Louisiana east to Cuba and north through New Jersey to Canada. Adults are on wing from April to August. There is one generation per year. The illustrated adult in this posting is not Catocala umbrosa, and no where is this species found in Cuba.

Aboriginal sites of New South Wales consist of a large number of places in the Australian state of New South Wales where it is still possible to see visible signs of the activities and culture of the Australian Aboriginals who previously occupied these areas. These sites are comparable with the petroglyphs of Native Americans and the Rock Art found elsewhere in Australia, but are not restricted to rock carvings. Many of the sites are on the (now defunct) Register of the National Estate. The Aboriginal Australians arrived in the north of Australia around 50,000 years ago. Sites over 22,000 years old have been found in the Blue Mountains area west of Sydney, while sites going back 40,000 years exist at Lake Mungo. There are some thousands of known sites, many but not all located in national parks. Some sites are also found in more suburban settings; rock carvings can be seen in the Sydney suburbs of Bondi and Tamarama. Their art was part of day-to-day life and would normally have had a purpose. One such purpose is thought to have been what some people call "wish fulfilment magic"—or sympathetic magic—in which the act of creating the magical work is thought to bring about the event depicted in the work. For example, a hunting scene—a common subject in rock carvings—would be aimed at bringing about the desired reality of good hunting. There were also many artworks that were created for specific ceremonial purposes and which were not intended to last after the ceremony was over. In addition to such themes, there were also works of a more secular nature, which could be created for a number of reasons, including the instruction and entertainment of children. There are substantial variations in the character of art developed in different parts of New South Wales. Art in the western part of the state could be very different from the art created in coastal areas. Aboriginal sites in the state are administered by the National Parks and Wildlife Service of New South Wales. All known sites are recorded on the register known as the Aboriginal Heritage Information Management System (AHIMS), which is run by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. There is generally a policy of protecting Aboriginal sites, although a small number of sites are publicised. Notable examples are those at the Basin Track, Ku-ring-gai Chase National Park, and the Bulgandry site, Brisbane Water National Park. However, most sites are not publicised, and restricted sites (colloquially known as sacred sites) will never be made public. If anyone thinks they have a legitimate reason for wanting to inspect sites that are not normally available to the public, they can apply to AHIMS for permission. The sites are of many different types, for example: Paintings cover a wide range of subjects, both spiritual and secular. Coloured pigmentation was created with ochre (giving a red/orange colour), charcoal (for a black pigmentation) and ash (for grey pigmentation). One good example is the rock shelter popularly known as Baiame's Cave, at Milbrodale, with paintings depicting a large figure that may be Baiame, the Sky Father. Rock carvings, also known as petroglyphs or Rock Engravings, are of a style known as "simple figurative", which conventional archaeological thinking dates to the last 5000 years. Other engravings show European sailing ships, and so cannot be more than about 200 years old. Thus we are left with a date range of 5000–200 years ago. It is likely that some of the freshest engravings represent the later part of that time range, whilst the most worn represent the earliest part. However, the situation is complicated by the fact that we know the engravings were sometimes "re-grooved" during ceremonies. Carvings could be very large. In some carvings, the figure of Baiame the Sky Father could be eighteen metres tall. In addition to pictorial carvings, there are many grinding grooves, caused by grinding stone implements on a rock surface to shape them and give them an edge. Areas like Sydney and the Blue Mountains have many rock carvings because they predominantly consist of sandstone (known as Hawkesbury sandstone), which is a very suitable surface for rock carvings. See Sydney Rock Engravings for the main article on these. Hand stencils can often be found in rock shelters and caves, which have given them protection from the elements over the years. They were created by placing the hand on a rocky surface and blowing pigmentation around it, leaving the silhouette of the hand on the rock. There is often a number of them in one place. The best-known example is Red Hands Cave, in the Blue Mountains National Park, which has many stencils, including those created by children as well as adults. Charcoal drawings were exactly that: drawings executed with a piece of charcoal. Like the rock carvings, they could be of a wide range of subjects, with animals often featured. Shell middens developed in occupation sites where shell fish were consumed. Over the years, layers of shells would build up, creating a concentration of many shells in the soil around the occupation site. Shield trees are seen occasionally in the Sydney bush. A substantial piece of bark would be cut out of a tree and used as a shield or tray. A visible "scar" was thus left behind, which could vary considerably in size, some being quite large. Restricted areas (otherwise known as sacred sites) are usually of a spiritual nature and were restricted to adult males and, in some cases, women. These sites could include ceremonial sites, bora grounds, men's sites and women's birthing sites. It is necessary to distinguish between occupation sites and sacred sites, a subject about which there is often great confusion. Many people think that all Aboriginal sites are "sacred sites", but the reality is more complex. Before white settlement, most indigenous sites were occupation sites, which were used by all members of a tribe. Sacred sites, on the other hand, were restricted to adult males, except for certain women's sites. In more recent times, all indigenous sites have become known as sacred sites; those that were previously known as sacred sites are now known as restricted sites. It is worth noting that there are many imitation sites, in which Europeans created imitations of Aboriginal art, usually in the form of rock carvings. One of the most prominent examples is a large carving of a kangaroo alongside a walking track at Grotto Point, in the Sydney Harbour National Park. This has been known for some time to be an imitation (or fake, as some would say).

Hugh Metcalfe is a musician and filmmaker from London and Suffolk, England. He is best known as the promoter of The Klinker in London, a club which he has run in various venues since at least 1982 (stories vary). He plays guitar, violin, hi-hat and gas mask. He performs in several bands including Bicycle Clip Sex, The Small Faeces, The Cross-Dressed Quartet and Fuck Off Batman. He also performed with noted sound poet Bob Cobbing, saxophonist Lol Coxhill and dancer Jennifer Pike in Birdyak, up until Cobbing's death in 2002. Metcalfe's experimental film work began in 1978, and uses 8mm film methods to produce silent films, often used later as a springboard for free musical improvisation, either by Metcalfe himself or other musicians. During some of the 1980s, Metcalfe ran a record label, 'Klinkerzoundz', releasing records by Metcalfe, Cobbing, the Bow Gamelan Ensemble, and more. The Klinker has, in its 30-year lifespan, acquired a reputation as London's leading forum for free improvisation and marginal music and performance. 

Formula One, abbreviated to F1, is the highest class of open-wheeled auto racing defined by the Fédération Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA), motorsport's world governing body. The "formula" in the name refers to a set of rules to which all participants and cars must conform. The F1 World Championship season consists of a series of races, known as Grands Prix, held usually on purpose-built circuits, and in a few cases on closed city streets. The polesitter is the driver that has qualified for a Grand Prix in pole position, at the front of the starting grid. Drivers are awarded points based on their position at the end of each race, and the driver who accumulates the most points over each calendar year is crowned that year's World Champion. Out of the 1,028 completed Grands Prix (as of the ), the driver that has qualified on pole position has gone on to win the race 432 times. Qualifying is traditionally contested on the Saturday of a Grand Prix weekend to determine the drivers' positions on the starting grid. Historically, there have been a number of different qualifying systems; previously, each driver was only allowed a single lap to set his qualifying time. Drivers currently have to compete in three rounds before pole position is determined. The first round, known as Q1, is contested by twenty drivers in an 18-minute session, at the end of which the five slowest cars are eliminated. This is followed by Q2, a 15-minute session, where the slowest five are again eliminated. The remaining ten cars contest Q3, the final 12-minute session to determine their places on the grid and who will sit on pole position. Lewis Hamilton holds the record for the most pole positions, having qualified first on occasions. Michael Schumacher is second with 68 pole positions. Ayrton Senna is third with 65 poles. Senna holds the record for the most consecutive pole positions; he qualified in first place eight Grands Prix in a row from the 1988 Spanish Grand Prix to the 1989 United States Grand Prix. Sebastian Vettel is the youngest polesitter; he was 21 years, 72 days old when he qualified in first place for the 2008 Italian Grand Prix. The oldest person to qualify in pole position was Nino Farina, who was 47 years, 79 days old when he was polesitter for the 1954 Argentine Grand Prix. As of the 2020 Russian Grand Prix, 100 drivers have been on pole position in the 1,028 Grands Prix since the first World Championship race, the 1950 British Grand Prix. Since 2014, the driver with the most pole positions in a season has been awarded the Pole Trophy. The inaugural Pole Trophy was won by Nico Rosberg, while Charles Leclerc was the most recent recipient of the award with 7 poles in 2019.

A MEX file is a type of computer file that provides an interface between MATLAB or Octave and functions written in C, C++ or Fortran. It stands for "MATLAB executable". When compiled, MEX files are dynamically loaded and allow external functions to be invoked from within MATLAB or Octave as if they were built-in functions. To support the development of MEX files, both MATLAB and Octave offer external interface functions that facilitate the transfer of data between MEX files and the workspace. In addition to MEX files, Octave has its own format using its own native API, with better performance. 

Turner Creek Park is a municipal park in Hillsboro in the U.S. state of Oregon. Opened about 1990, the park is located in the middle of the city along Turner Creek near southwest 32nd Avenue between Tualatin Valley Highway and Main Street. The park includes a playground, restrooms, several sports facilities, and natural areas with trails. Turner Creek Park opened about 1990 near W. L. Henry Elementary School and southwest 32nd Avenue in the center of Hillsboro. Construction included building dams and trails along the creek, with some labor provided by an alternative school program paid for by the federal government. During construction the city received donation of nearly 100 trees from a local nursery and Portland General Electric, with volunteers providing the labor to plant the trees. During the summer of 1992 some trees at the park died due to a drought. The city sought to receive 75 live former Christmas trees in donations from local residents after Christmas in 1992 to plant at the park to replace those that died. From 1993 to 1994, the city’s parks and recreation department worked with civic groups and used a grant to improve the natural areas of the park, which included consolidation of a variety of trails, plantings, and adding bird houses. A wildflower garden was added in 1997. Bisected by Turner Creek, the wetlands area of the park and the creek have experienced numerous sewer overflows beginning around 1995. An older sewer line runs along the creek and passes through the park on its way south to the wastewater treatment plant operated by Clean Water Services at Rock Creek. The city was fined $32,000 by the state over its clean up of spills in 2006. The park played host to Heritage Christian School’s Latin Olympika games in 2003. City residents rejected a bond measure in November 2008 that would have paid for improvements at Turner Creek Park among six other parks as well as a recreation center at 53rd Avenue Park. As of August 2009, Turner Creek was one of only three parks in the city that had not been adopted under the parks departments adopt a park program. A new playground was installed in a single day by volunteers in August 2018. The park includes athletic facilities, wetlands, and wooded sections. Features include play equipment for children, picnic areas, restrooms, and parking. Sports features are two tennis courts, one soccer field, and two softball fields. The natural area on the west side of the park has paved and wood chip trails leading to a boardwalk and bridge across Turner Creek. These trails run down a small canyon that separates the improved portions of the park from the creek and connect to the elementary school. About four acres are along the creek, which was changed to meander through the area which includes ponds and islands. The city changed the stream by building small dikes that are closed in the summertime to collect water and create pools for use by wildlife, including great blue herons. Other animals at the park include garter snakes, gulls, frogs, fish, and blackbirds among others. Flora include purple iris, sedges, nodding beggar-tick, knotweed, jewelweed, and "Veronica".

Last Mission is a top-down multidirectional shooter developed by Data East and distributed in worldwide release for the arcades in 1986. The game is similar to Time Pilot as players have full movement control over their ship and can move it in all eight directions. The players assume the role of an alien-humanoid space pilot who has been exiled from their home galaxy for committing an unlearned crime. The only way the player character can return is to restore their honor; the only way to do so is to invade and defeat the alien invaders who have been known to frequently attack the player character's people using a ship called the Main Fighter. In Japan, "Game Machine" listed "Last Mission" on their December 1, 1986 issue as being the fourth most-successful table arcade unit of the year. 

Heronbridge Roman Site is the remains of a Roman settlement on both sides of Watling Street, about south of Chester in Cheshire, England, with evidence of industrial activity (furnaces) in the late 1st and 2nd centuries. The site is a Scheduled Ancient Monument. The site was found by chance by a member of Chester Archaeological Society in 1929. It lies in undeveloped land, offering the prospect of a site undisturbed in modern times, with much scope for investigators. Excavations took place in 1930–31 and found human remains with evidence of violent deaths. Further investigations took place in 2003–04, and the site was also a target of the archaeological television programme "Time Team" in 2005. In the 2010s about a dozen skeletons from the 1930-31 excavation were re-identified in the collections of the Manchester Museum, the majority exhibiting severe trauma injuries. Carbon-dating of two further skeletons, uncovered in 2004, is consistent with a date of death in the early 7th century. The settlement was founded on the west bank of the River Dee in the late 1st century AD. It became a significant settlement, with many established stone buildings and a quayside cut into the bedrock. There are also indications of a river bridge in the area, and evidence of trade in coal (dated to about AD 200) has been found at the inland port. After Roman occupation ended, around AD 350, the town decayed into ruin. Overlying part of the Roman town's site, between Watling Street and the river, is an enclosure. It is believed to be an Anglo-Saxon military encampment thrown up after the Battle of Chester (AD 611 according to the Irish Annals). The earthwork was reinforced by masonry recovered from the Roman ruins. Archaeological excavations have uncovered a post-Roman mass grave beneath the defensive earthwork, which may hold Northumbrian casualties of the Battle of Chester. The battle was an Anglian victory by King Aethelfrith of Northumbria over a Welsh army. There are three alternative explanations for the earthwork enclosure, however. One is that it was built by Norse-Irish settlers led by Ingimundr, who established themselves near Chester about AD 905 and subsequently tried to capture the city. Second, D-shaped defensive compounds sited beside rivers, such as the Heronsgate earthwork, are a recognised feature of the Viking Age. Third, it could have been constructed very much later, perhaps being one of the positions set up during the Siege of Chester by Parliamentary forces in 1644. 

Douglaseraie des Farges is a French state-owned forest of ten hectares located in Meymac, Corrèze. "Douglaseraie des Farges" was planted in 1895 with "Pseudotsuga menziesii" (Coast Douglas-fir). These trees can reach heights of up to 50 metres (164 ft.) and a canopy volume up to 15 m³ (530 ft³). They have measured ten trees; the highest ones were 56 m (184 ft.) with a diameter of 1.04 m (3.4 ft.): 

Avraham Rafael Drori (, born Abram Kozinski; 23 May 1919 – 20 August 1964) was an Israeli politician who served as a member of the Knesset for Herut between 1961 and 1964. Born in Łódź in Poland, Drori was a member of the Betar youth movement. He made aliyah to Mandatory Palestine in 1935, and was a member of the Betar enlistment units in Samaria and the Galilee. He joined the Irgun, and was later co-opted into the IDF, from which he was demobilised with the rank of major. He joined Herut, and later became its general secretary. He was on the party's list for the 1959 elections, but was not placed high enough on the list to win a seat. However, he entered the Knesset on 21 March 1961 as a replacement for the deceased Shimshon Unichman. He retained his seat in the November 1961 elections, but died in office in August 1964 at the age of 45. His seat was taken by Yosef Kremerman. 

In 2009, an advertisement promoting Enigmatic Malaysia featured Balinese Pendet dancers which it incorrectly showed to be a Malaysian dance, which caused anger in Indonesia. The advertisement was shown by a private company in Singapore for a Discovery Channel programme on Malaysia. This prompted protest in Indonesia. Demands were made from the local governments, cultural historians as well as the tourism ministry in Indonesia for Malaysia to clarify the situation. The Malaysian government offered their apologies for the mistake done by the company, which was rejected by the Indonesian tourism minister, since the apology was given informally by phone, the Indonesian tourism minister demanded a written apology to make it more accountable. The Malaysian government says it was not responsible for the advertisement, and later said that Discovery TV sent an apology letter to the two countries, which said that the network was responsible for the advertisement. Many Indonesian editorials and news stories continue to report that the offending clip is a Malaysian government advertisement despite Discovery's Singapore official apology. Indonesian ultra-nationalists held anti-Malaysia demonstrations. The group Gemars began a registration for war against Malaysia and has stockpiled food, medicine and weapons including samurai swords and ninja throwing stars. A group of armed men set up road-blocks to check for Malaysians on a Jakarta street before police contained their activity. The group later dispersed itself without finding any Malaysians. Malaysian students of Gadjah Mada University in Yogyakarta had rotten eggs thrown at them by local undergraduates. The Ambassador of the Republic of Indonesia to Malaysia, was contacted by Foreign Minister of Malaysia to express Malaysia's position on the issue that has resulted in the deterioration of the bilateral relations of both countries. The Ambassador of Indonesia has contacted the Minister of Foreign Affairs of Indonesia as well as the Chief of the Indonesian National Police, who have assured that necessary measures will be taken to ensure the security of Malaysian citizens in Indonesia. National Security Council secretary, Datuk Mohamed Tajudeen Abdul Wahab have instructed all Malaysian borders, which were manned by the military, had been tightened and enforcement agencies have been told to gear up for any possibility of members of the group penetrating Malaysian shores. This is in response to Indonesia's Benteng Demokrasi Rakyat (Bendera) threat to wage war by sending 1,500 troops – armed with sharpened bamboo – to Malaysia by air, land and sea on 08/10/2009. The group is the same one which had set up roadblocks in Menteng, Central Jakarta last month, in search of Malaysians., 

Criticism of the United Nations has encompassed numerous arguments regarding various aspects of the organization, such as policy, ideology, equality of representation, administration, ability to enforce rulings, and ideological bias. Oft-cited points of criticism include a perceived lack of the body's efficacy, rampant anti-Semitism, appeasement, promotion of globalism, abuse of power by nations exerting general control over the assembly, a number of legislative decisions seen as abandonment of, among other things, the prevention of armed conflict clause(s) detailed in the Charter of the United Nations, corruption, a total lack of efficacy in both pre-emptive measures and de-escalation of existing conflicts which have ranged from social disputes to all-out wars, and misappropriation of resources. In 2004, former ambassador to the UN Dore Gold published a book called "Tower of Babble: How the United Nations Has Fueled Global Chaos". The book criticized what it called the organization's moral relativism in the face of (and occasional support of) genocide and terrorism that occurred between the moral clarity of its founding period and the present day. While the UN during its founding period was limited to those countries that declared war on at least one of the Axis powers of World War II, and thus were capable of taking a stand against war, the modern United Nations has, according to Gold, become diluted to the point where only 75 of the 184 member states during the time of the book's publication "were free democracies, according to Freedom House." He further claimed that this had the effect of tipping the scales of the UN so that the organization as a whole was more amenable to the requirements of dictatorships. The UN General Assembly decided to hold a moment of silence in honor of North Korean dictator Kim Jong-il following his death in 2011. Western diplomats criticized the decision. "An official at the Czech Republic's UN mission said the Czechs did not request a similar moment of silence for Václav Havel, the playwright-turned-dissident who died" a day after Kim. Some critics of the UN have alleged that it threatens national sovereignty and promotes globalism. In the United States, an early opponent of the UN was the John Birch Society, which began a "get US out of the UN" campaign in 1959, charging that the UN's aim was to establish a one-world government. Charles de Gaulle of France criticized the UN, famously calling it "le machin", and was not convinced that a global security alliance would help in maintaining world peace, preferring the UN to direct defense treaties between countries. The United Nations Population Fund has been accused by different groups of providing support for government programs which have promoted forced-abortions and coercive sterilizations. Controversies regarding these allegations have resulted in a sometimes shaky relationship between the organization and the United States government, with three presidential administrations, that of Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush withholding funding from the UNFPA. The UNFPA provided aid to Peru's population control program in the mid-to-late '90s when it was discovered the Peruvian program had been engaged in carrying out coercive sterilizations. The UNFPA was not found directly involved in the scandal, but continued to fund and work with the population control program after the abuses had become public. The issue played a role in the Bush administration's decision in 2002 to cut off funding for the organization. There has been criticism that the five permanent members of the United Nations Security Council (China, France, Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States), who are all nuclear powers, have created an exclusive nuclear club whose powers are unchecked. Unlike the General Assembly, the United Nations Security Council does not have true international representation. This has led to accusations that the UNSC only addresses the strategic interests and political motives of the permanent members, especially in humanitarian interventions: for example, protecting the oil-rich Kuwaitis in 1991 but poorly protecting resource-poor Rwandans in 1997. Any country may be elected to serve a temporary term on the Security Council, but critics have suggested that this is inadequate. Rather, they argue, the number of permanent members should be expanded to include non-nuclear powers, which would democratize the organization. Still other countries have advocated abolishing the concept of permanency altogether; under the government of Paul Martin, Canada advocated this approach. Another criticism of the Security Council involves the veto power of the five permanent members. As it stands, a veto from any of the permanent members can halt any possible action the Council may take. One country's objection, rather than the opinions of a majority of countries, may cripple any possible UN armed or diplomatic response to a crisis. As part of the Soviet Union, Russia vetoed 90 resolutions between 1949 and 1991. As of July 2019, USSR and Russia vetoed 141 times, United States 83 times, UK 32 times, France 18 times, and China 14 times. John J. Mearsheimer noted that "since 1982, the US has vetoed 32 Security Council resolutions critical of Israel, more than the total number of vetoes cast by all the other Security Council members." Since candidates for the Security Council are proposed by regional blocs, the Arab League and its allies are usually included but Israel, which joined the UN in 1949, has never been elected to the Security Council. The Council has repeatedly condemned Israel. On the other hand, critics contend that, while Israel has the United States to rely on to veto any pertinent legislation against it, the Palestinians lack any such power. Apart from the US, several resolutions have been vetoed by Russia, notably attempts to impose sanctions on Syria during the Syrian Civil War and to condemn Russia's own annexation of Crimea in 2014. In the case of the latter, Russia's lone veto overruled the thirteen other votes in favor of the condemnation. Russia vetoed a UN resolution condemning the USSR's shooting down of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 in 1983. The veto has been singled out as a threat to human rights, with Amnesty International claiming that the five permanent members had used their veto to "promote their political self-interest or geopolitical interest above the interest of protecting civilians." As of 2014, Amnesty International has suggested that a solution would involve the five permanent members surrendering their veto on issues of genocide. Some see the fact that veto power is exclusive to the permanent five as being anachronistic and unjust, given that the United Nations is meant to equally represent all its member states. Aside from criticism directed towards its biased nature, others have pointed out that the veto makes it difficult for the Security Council to solve issues. Whilst addressing the UN General Assembly on the Russian annexation of Crimea, Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko said the following regarding the inefficiency of the veto "In every democratic country, if someone has stolen your property, an independent court will restore justice, in order to protect your rights, and punish the offender. However, we must recognize that in the 21st century our organization lacks an effective instrument to bring to justice an aggressor country that has stolen the territory of another sovereign state.” The practice of the permanent members meeting privately and then presenting their resolutions to the full council as a "fait accompli" has also drawn criticism; according to Erskine Barton Childers, "the vast majority of members – North as well as South – have made very clear...their distaste for the way three Western powers ["the UK, US, and France"] behave in the Council, like a private club of hereditary elite-members who secretly come to decisions and then emerge to tell the grubby elected members that they may now rubber-stamp those decisions." In this case, the United Nations has received some criticism in its gender-inclusivity and its reception of feminist viewpoints. While at the large scale the UN provides outlets and aid to women through UN Women and the Sustainable Development Goals, the reality is that the UN is still very male-dominated. While it has achieved gender parity in its employees at the two lowest levels of responsibility (P-1 and P-2), equal representation has not yet been achieved at any levels higher than these. Senior leadership as of 2015 was made up of 78% men, and parity is not expected for another 112 years based on current trends. Both the percentage of appointments made and the likelihood and speed at which employees are promoted mirror the trend above; parity achieved at low levels while at the D-2 level women see roughly a quarter of what their male counterparts do. One reason attributed with the slow progress is that there are no methods to hold the UN accountable to its proposed changes due to its size and the different approaches taken within the different subsidiaries of the organization. Other critics object to the idea that the UN is a democratic organization, saying that it represents the interests of the governments of the countries who form it and not necessarily the individuals within those countries. World federalist Dieter Heinrich points out that the powerful Security Council system does not have distinctions between the legislative, executive, and judiciary branches: the United Nations Charter gives all three powers to the Security Council. According to Yigal Palmor, former spokesman of the Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the multi-sections system of the UN prevents individual players or those who don't have geographical friends from participating in the United Nations System. He says that Israel is the only UN member, in the whole UN system, that has been prevented by the UN from playing the game like everyone else. Palmor asserts that due to the multi-sections system of the UN, Israel is being systematically excluded from all geographical sections and groups, and due to that Israel can't even apply to most of the UN councils. Israel originally should belong to the geographic section of Asia, but due to objection from Arab and Muslim countries in the region (such as Iran, Iraq etc.) it has been excluded, since its establishment. From time to time Israel has been accepted in the "Western countries and more" sections, but it is very limited. Israel became part of a regional grouping (the Western European and Others group) temporarily in 2000, gaining permanency status in 2014, 65 years after becoming a U.N. affiliated country. According to a study by Ilyana Kuziemko and Eric Werker, there is a strong connection between the distribution of foreign aid payments and rotating membership of the United Nations Security Council. Regarding the US foreign aid expenditure, ODA (Official Development Assistance)—receiving countries which hold a rotating seat of the UNSC experience on average a rise of 59% in payments ($16 million); concerning financial support from the United Nations, an increase of 8% ($1 million) is being detected. This rise in payments does however not apply the whole time: Kuziemko and Werker used a “New York Times”-Index to differentiate between important and unimportant years. The more the UN and the UNSC were mentioned in the New York Times, the more important the year was considered. The Korean War in the early 1950s, the Congo War in the early 1960s, and the numerous peacekeeping missions in the 1990s were decisive events. During unimportant and medium important years, ODA-receiving countries with a seat in the UNSC did not experience a significant rise in aid payments. During important years however, an increase of 170% could be detected ($16 million more). Regarding UN payments, the difference also exists, but is not as high (53% more financial support or $8 million during important years). One of the reasons could be that it is easier for the US to quickly distribute money, while aid payments of the United Nations mean a lot of bureaucracy beforehand. Kuziemko and Werker believe that this increase in payments does not happen because the ODA-receiving countries on the security council are able to use the chance and raise awareness for their problems. As soon as the country's time in council is over, the financial aid drops to the level prior to the time serving on the United Nations Security Council. However, the financial aid payments are noted to have already risen the year before the two-year term on the UNSC. The increase of aid payments is especially high regarding financial support by the United Nations Children's Emergency Fund (UNICEF). During years with a high importance measured by the “New-York-Times”- Index, UNICEF offers 63% more funds to ODA-receiving countries serving on the UNSC than before they had a seat. Kuziemko and Werker argue that since its founding in 1947, the head of UNICEF has always held US citizenship. Therefore, the executive directors may be the long arm of the US government and pursue the interest of the United States through UNICEF. A similar, although not as significant increase can be seen regarding the distribution of aid payments through UNDP. It is impossible though to say if the increase of foreign aid payments by the US or by the UN have changed receiving countries' voting behavior, as they would never admit being open for bribery. Some have questioned whether the UN might be relevant in the 21st century. While the UN's first and second Charter mandates require the UN: “To maintain international peace and security... (and if necessary to enforce the peace by) taking preventive or enforcement action,” due to its restrictive administrative structure, the permanent members of the Security Council themselves have sometimes prevented the UN from fully carrying out its first two mandates. Without the unanimous approval, support (or minimally abstention) of all five of the permanent members of the UN's Security Council, the UN's charter only enables it to "observe", report on, and make recommendations regarding international conflicts. Such unanimity on the Security Council regarding the authorization of armed UN enforcement actions has not always been reached in time to prevent the outbreak of international wars. In 1962, UN secretary general U Thant provided valuable assistance and took a great deal of time, energy and initiative as the primary negotiator between Nikita Khrushchev and John F. Kennedy during the Cuban Missile Crisis, thus providing a critical link in the prevention of a nuclear war at that time. A 2005 RAND Corporation study found the UN to be successful in two out of three peacekeeping efforts. It compared UN nation-building efforts to those of the United States, and found that seven out of eight UN cases are at peace, as opposed to four out of eight US cases at peace. Also in 2005, the Human Security Report documented a decline in the number of wars, genocides and human rights abuses since the end of the Cold War, and presented evidence, albeit circumstantial, that international activism – mostly spearheaded by the UN – has been the main cause of the decline in armed conflict since the end of the Cold War or due to the fact the US and USSR were no longer pumping up oppressive governments after the Cold war ended. The bureaucratic dimension of the UN has been a cause for frustration with the organization. In 1994, former Special Representative of the Secretary-General of the UN to Somalia Mohamed Sahnoun published "Somalia: The Missed Opportunities", a book in which he analyses the reasons for the failure of the 1992 UN intervention in Somalia; he shows in particular that, between the start of the Somali Civil War in 1988 and the fall of the Siad Barre regime in January 1991, the United Nations missed at least three opportunities to prevent major human tragedies. When the UN tried to provide humanitarian assistance, they were totally outperformed by NGOs, whose competence and dedication sharply contrasted with the United Nations’ bureaucratic inefficiencies and excessive caution (most UN envoys to Somalia operating from the safety of their desks in Nairobi rather than visiting clan leaders in the field). If sweeping reform was not undertaken, warned Mohamed Sahnoun, then the United Nations would continue to respond to such crisis in a climate of inept improvisation. Other critics and even proponents of the United Nations question its effectiveness and relevance because in most high-profile cases, there are essentially no consequences for violating a Security Council resolution. An early example of this was the Bangladesh Liberation War and the 1971 Bangladesh genocide committed by the Pakistan Army on Bangladeshis. Critics of the UN argued that the UN was completely ineffective in preventing the genocide, and that military intervention by India was the only thing to stop the mass murder. Another such case occurred in the Srebrenica massacre where Serbian troops committed genocide against Bosnian Muslims in the largest case of mass murder on the European continent since World War II. Srebrenica had been declared a UN "safe area" and was even protected by 400 armed Dutch peacekeepers, but the UN forces did nothing to prevent the massacre. In the 21st century, the most prominent and dramatic example is the War in Darfur, in which Arab Janjaweed militias, supported by the Sudanese government, committed repeated acts of ethnic cleansing and genocide against the indigenous population. As of 2013, an estimated 300,000 civilians have been killed in what is the largest case of mass murder in the history of the region, yet the UN has continuously failed to act against this severe and ongoing human rights issue. At the 68th Session of the UN General Assembly, New Zealand Prime Minister John Key heavily criticized the UN's inaction on Syria, more than two years after the Syrian Civil War began. In 1967, Richard Nixon, while running for President of the United States, criticized the UN as "obsolete and inadequate" for dealing with then-present crises like the Cold War. Jeane Kirkpatrick, who was appointed by Ronald Reagan to be United States Ambassador to the United Nations, wrote in a 1983 opinion piece in "The New York Times" that the process of discussions at the Security Council "more closely resembles a mugging" of the United States "than either a political debate or an effort at problem-solving." Issues relating to the state of Israel, Palestinians and other aspects of the Arab–Israeli conflict occupy a large amount of debate time, resolutions and resources at the United Nations. The former Secretary of State of the United States, John Kerry, has accused the U.N. Human Rights Council of focusing disproportionately on allegations of abuses by Israel, and Ban Ki-moon, the Secretary-General of the United Nations, admitted that there is a biased attitude against Israel at the UN, although he retracted later. Other critics such as Dore Gold, Alan Dershowitz, Mark Dreyfus, Robert S. Wistrich, Alan Keyes, and the Anti-Defamation League also consider UN attention on Israel's treatment of Palestinians to be excessive. According to Wistrich, "a third of all critical resolutions passed by [the UN] Human Rights Commission during the past forty years have been directed exclusively at Israel. By way of comparison, there has not been a single resolution even mentioning the massive violations of human rights in China, Russia, North Korea, Cuba, Saudi Arabia, Syria, or Zimbabwe." The adoption of UNSCOP's recommendation to partition Palestine by the United Nations General Assembly in 1947 was one of the earliest decisions of the UN. Noted lawyer Alan Dershowitz, after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War, the UN defined the term "refugee" as applied to Palestinian Arabs fleeing Israel in significantly broader terms than it did for other refugees of other conflicts. The UNHCR, responsible for all refugees but the Palestinians, limits refugee status only to those who fled/were dispossessed of their homes and lands; by contrast, the UNRWA, responsible for Palestinian refugees, extends refugee status to descendants of the original refugees. In 2007, United Nations Human Rights Council president Doru Romulus Costea said that the UNHRC had "failed" in dealing with the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The UN has sponsored several peace negotiations between Israel and its neighbors, the latest being the 2002 Road map for peace. The controversial Resolution 3379 (1975), which equated Zionism with racism, was rescinded in 1991. Noted Robert S. Wistrich: "on the same day Resolution 3379 was adopted, the General Assembly decided to establish the 'Committee on the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People.' With a large budget at its disposal and acting as an integral part of the United Nations, it has for more than thirty years done everything within its power to establish a Palestinian state in place of Israel." The UN has been accused by Dershowitz, human rights activists Elie Wiesel, Anne Bayefsky, and Bayard Rustin, historian Robert S. Wistrich, and feminists Phyllis Chesler and Sonia Johnson of tolerating antisemitic remarks within its walls. Israeli delegates to the UN "have been treated to a sickening litany of anti-Semitic abuse at the General Assembly, in the UN Human Rights Commission, and sometimes even in the Security Council" for decades. UN conferences throughout the 1970s and into the 1980s often passed resolutions denouncing Zionism. These conferences often did not have anything to do with Middle East politics. UN documents of the period systematically denied the existence of the Jews, Israel ancient history, the Holocaust, and the notion that Jews deserve the same rights granted to other groups. Wistrich described the 1980 World Conference of the United Nations Decade for Women in Copenhagen in his book, "A Lethal Obsession": "Jewish feminists heard truly chilling comments, such as 'The only good Jew is a dead Jew' and 'The only way to rid the world of Zionism is to kill all the Jews.' One eye-witness overheard other delegates saying that the American women's movement had a bad name because its most prominent founding figures ... were all Jewish. The feminist activist Sonia Johnson described the anti-Semitism at the Copenhagen conference as 'over, wild, and irrational.' ... The psychologist and author Phyllis Chesler recorded the savage response when one Jewish woman mentioned that her husband had been shot without a trial in Iraq and that she had to escape to Israel with her children. The place went wild: 'Cuba si! Yankee no! PLO! PLO!' they shouted. 'Israel kills babies and women. Israel must die.'" The most infamous example of this trend was the passage of United Nations General Assembly Resolution 3379, which equated Zionism with racism, on November 10, 1975. It was the first postwar ideology to ever be condemned in the United Nations' history. The resolution was internationally condemned in the media (especially in the media of Western countries). Many observers noted that the resolution was passed on the thirty-seventh anniversary of Kristallnacht, the pogrom historians agree marked the beginning of the Holocaust. A UN sponsored conference was held in 2001 in Durban, South Africa. The conference was meant to combat racism, but ended up being a forum for world leaders to make various anti-Semitic statements. Among the anti-Semitic literature freely handed out at the conference were cartoons equating the Nazi swastika with the Jewish Star of David, flyers expressing the wish that Adolf Hitler had completely killed every last Jew on Earth, and copies of "The Protocols of the Elders of Zion". Tom Lantos, Colin Powell, Chuck Schumer, Elie Wiesel, Irwin Cotler, Alan Dershowitz, and Robert S. Wistrich condemned the entire conference, calling it hateful, racist, and anti-Semitic. According to Dore Gold, Alan Dershowitz, and Robert S. Wistrich, the United Nations has a long history of elevating what it calls "national liberation movements," armed groups who commit violence against civilians to achieve political goals, virtually to the status of civilians. In 1974 and again in 1988, the UN invited Yasser Arafat to address the General Assembly. Alan Dershowitz accused the UN of allowing states that sponsor terrorism to sit on the Security Council. These visits legitimized the PLO without it "having to renounce terrorism." In July 1976, Palestinian and German terrorists hijacked an Air France plane headed from France to Israel, landed it in Uganda, and threatened to kill the civilian hostages. Ugandan dictator Idi Amin provided sanctuary for the terrorists in the Entebbe airport. After Israel raided the Ugandan airport and rescued most of the hostages, United Nations Secretary-General Kurt Waldheim condemned Israel for the violation of "Ugandan sovereignty." Alan Dershowitz stated that while Tibetan people, Kurds, and Turkish Armenians all desire "national liberation," the United Nations has only officially recognized Palestinian claims to "national liberation" and allows representatives of the Palestinian cause to speak at the UN. The difference between the three groups and the Palestinians is that the Palestinians use terrorism as a tactic for getting their voice heard, while the Tibetans and Turkish Armenians do not. The UN, according to Dershowitz, favors "national liberation" groups who practice terrorism above those who do not, including those people who have been under more brutal occupation for a longer time (such as Tibetans). Dershowitz has accused the UN of allowing its refugee camps in the Palestinian territories to be used as terrorist bases. A review of UN action during the final months of the Sri Lankan Civil War in 2009, in which tens of thousands of people were killed, criticized the UN leadership, United Nations Security Council and top UN officials in Sri Lanka. UN staff were afraid to publicize widespread killings, top UN leaders did not intervene and the 15-member Security Council did not give "clear" orders to protect civilians, said the report. The review, led by former UN official Charles Petrie, said senior UN staff in Sri Lanka were afraid to highlight deaths because they feared it would put at risk humanitarian access to the hundreds of thousands of civilians in the region. UN staff in Sri Lanka and New York failed to "confront" the government about obstacles to humanitarian assistance and were unwilling to "address government responsibility for attacks that were killing civilians." Rights groups have given a toll of up to 40,000 dead with most killed in army shelling. The report said UN headquarters' talks with the 193 member states "were heavily influenced by what it perceived member states wanted to hear, rather than what member states needed to know if they were to respond." Turning to the Security Council, the report said the body had been "deeply ambivalent" about putting Sri Lanka on its conflict agenda. Philippe Bolopion, UN director for Human Rights Watch, said the report highlighted a "dereliction of duty" and was "a call to action and reform for the entire UN system." Since 1971, when the Republic of China (Taiwan) was forced to give up its seat at the UN to the People's Republic of China, the self-governed island of 23 million has been wandering in the diplomatic wilderness, barred from the United Nations and affiliated bodies like the World Health Organization while its Olympic athletes are forced to compete under the banner of Chinese Taipei. The UN recognizes and abides by the One-China Policy which states that there is only one China and Taiwan is part of it. This has created a gap between Taiwan and the world because the People's Republic of China does not have jurisdiction over Taiwan. Taiwan's United Nations Task Force director, Joanne Ou, has stated that "The United Nations talks about justice and human rights, yet they pretend we don’t exist. It’s humiliating, ridiculous and childish." In the book "Snakes in Suits", a study of psychopaths in the workplace, Babiak and Hare write that corruption appears to be endemic at the UN: In addition to criticism of the basic approach, the Oil-for-Food Programme suffered from widespread corruption and abuse. Throughout its existence, the programme was dogged by accusations that some of its profits were unlawfully diverted to the government of Iraq and to UN officials. Reporters witnessed a rapid increase in prostitution in Cambodia, Mozambique, Bosnia, and Kosovo after UN and, in the case of the latter two, NATO peacekeeping forces moved in. In the 1996 UN study "The Impact of Armed Conflict on Children", former first lady of Mozambique Graça Machel documented: "In 6 out of 12 country studies on sexual exploitation of children in situations of armed conflict prepared for the present report, the arrival of peacekeeping troops has been associated with a rapid rise in child prostitution." In 2011, a United Nations spokesman confirmed sixteen Beninese peacekeepers were barred from serving with them following a year-long probe. Of the sixteen soldiers involved, ten were commanders. They failed to maintain an environment that prevents sexual exploitation and abuse. Sexual misconduct by United Nations troops had earlier been reported in Congo, Cambodia, and Haiti, as well as in an earlier incident involving Moroccan peacekeepers in Côte d'Ivoire. In 2007, American diplomat James Wasserstrom raised concerns about corruption amongst UN officials in Kosovo. He was dismissed from his field job and detained by UN police. He brought a case against the UN and General Secretary Ban Ki-Moon, and at his tribunal the UN was directed to compensate him with US$65,000 for the wrongful dismissal. UN aid workers from Nepal were identified as the source of a cholera outbreak which killed over 10,000 Haitians and sickened hundreds of thousands more. Yet the UN claimed diplomatic immunity and refused to provide compensation. 

Space Power (SPTV) (Arabic: سبيس باور) was an Arabian TV channel featuring anime programs targeted at the youth audience. Based in Damascus, Syria, the channel began broadcasting on 8 March 2008 with content from the Al Zuhra Company in Syria, Network Today in Damascus and Dubai. In 2014, Space Power closed down. However, on November 16, 2016, Space Power returned as a programming block in the Spacetoon channel starting from 10:30 pm Mecca time until midnight and displaying all the dubbing works in its favor with the exchange of logos between Space Power and Spacetoon every 10 seconds. In 2019, some of the Space Power programs were added to the Spacetoon Go app. And In 2019, a new program called Magic Kaito was added to the Space Power menu in the Spacetoon Go app, making it the first program for Space Power after closing the channel. 

Dan Rosescu (September 25, 1944 in Bucharest, Romania – September 21, 2004 in Los Angeles, CA, US) was a Romanian-American professional handball player and coach Dan started his handball career at the "Clubul Sportiv Scolar" in Bucharest, Romania, back in 1961–1962, having Cristian Gatu, Gheorghe Goran, and Mihai Marinescu as teammates, and Virgil Trofin as a coach. CSS, having such elite players, won multiple Junior League National championships, and also multiple international tournaments. Later on, Dan Rosescu was drafted by Steaua Bucharest Club in 1964, where he helped the club become 3 times National Champions, and European Champions in 1968. Dan Rosescu relocated to the US in 1984, at age 40. In the US, he helped form the "Los Angeles Crusaders" handball team, where he was active as a player and coach. Best result: 7th place at the 1985 US Championships in Colorado Springs, CO. A few years later, he was selected by the US Team Handball Federation, to coach the US West Coast male team for the Pre-Olympics National Tournament. The West Coast Team won the tournament that year. 

Thomas Darbyshire (1518–1604) was an English churchman and Jesuit. He was a nephew of Edmund Bonner by a sister. He received his education at Broadgates Hall, Oxford, where he graduated B.A. in 1544, B.C.L. in 1553, and D.C.L. on 20 July 1556. His uncle collated him to the prebend of Totenhall in St Paul's Cathedral on 23 July 1543, to the rectory of Hackney on 26 May 1554, to the rectory of Fulham on 1 October 1558, to the archdeaconry of Essex on 22 October 1558, and to the rectory of St. Magnus, near London Bridge, on 27 November 1558. He was also chancellor of the diocese of London, in which capacity he examined Protestants who were brought before Bishop Bonner about matters of faith. On the accession of Elizabeth I, he was a conspicuous Catholic, and was deprived of all his preferments. He remained in England, however, for some time, and was deputed to attend the Council of Trent. He was sent in order to procure an opinion on the point, then controversial, whether the Catholic faithful might frequent the Protestant churches in order to avoid the penalties decreed against recusants. He brought back an answer to the effect that attendance at the heretical worship would be a great sin. It was at his prompting that the fathers of the Council passed the decree "De non adeundis Haereticorum ecclesiis". He afterwards suffered imprisonment in London, and eventually left England. He visited several parts of France and Flanders, and entered the Society of Jesus on 1 May 1563, at St. Andrew's Novitiate, Rome. He was sent first to Monaco and then to the University of Dillingen. Then the pope gave him a mission to Scotland, along with Father Edmund Hay, to the apostolic nuncio Vincentius Laurens who had been consecrated bishop, and appointed his successor in the see of Monte Regale. The object of this mission is unclear but probably connected with affairs of Mary, Queen of Scots. Subsequently he was ordered to France, having been appointed master of novices at Billom. He became a professed father of the Society of Jesus in 1572. For some years he lectured in Latin to the members of the Sodality of the Blessed Virgin. This was probably at Paris, where he was residing in 1575-6, and again in 1579 and in 1583. While in Paris, he was an important early influence on Robert Southwell. Among his converts were Henry Fitzsimon and George Gilbert. He visited William Allen in the English college at Rheims, who thought highly of him. He retired to Pont-à-Mousson in Lorraine, where he died on 6 April 1604. Some of his letters, intercepted by the English government, were printed by Henry Foley. 

Mutau is a village in the north eastern part of Namibia in the Caprivi region. It is situated along the Linyanti road. The name Mutau means "big lion". mutau played a big role in the community wellbeing. Mutau was one of the few settler to arrive in the caprivi region. 

Doctor Who: The Lost Stories is a sci-fi audio series produced by Big Finish Productions of "Doctor Who" audio plays adapted from unused TV stories. The first series is largely adapted from stories planned for the unmade 1985–1986 series. Colin Baker and Nicola Bryant star as the Sixth Doctor and Peri. Clegg wrote a detailed story breakdown for "Point of Entry", which Platt turned into a complete script. Hammond wrote an incomplete script for "Paradise 5", which was completed and adapted for audio by Lane. Martin, Bidmead, and Mills have revised their own scripts, with Bidmead describing his revision as a "top-to-bottom rewrite". Paul Finch approached Big Finish with a complete script that his father Brian had written for Season 22 in 1985. The story was completely unknown to Big Finish before this. Michael Feeney Callan's "The Children of January" was originally part of the line-up, but fell through due to the author's other commitments and was replaced by "The Macros". <section begin=series1 /><section end=series1 /> The first release of the second series is "The First Doctor Boxset", a four-disc boxed set including Moris Farhi's stories "Farewell Great Macedon" and "The Fragile Yellow Arc of Fragrance". Farhi's scripts for "Farewell Great Macedon" have been adapted as an enhanced audiobook, performed by William Russell and Carole Ann Ford, who, respectively, played Ian Chesterton and Susan Foreman. The second release is "The Second Doctor Boxset", another four-disc boxed set including Dick Sharples' "The Prison in Space". Sharples' story has been adapted by Simon Guerrier, and is performed by Frazer Hines and Wendy Padbury, who played Jamie McCrimmon and Zoe Heriot. The set also includes "The Destroyers", the unmade pilot episode of a proposed Dalek-centred spin-off series for American TV. The episode has been adapted as a full-cast drama, with Nicholas Briggs as the voice of the Daleks. The remaining releases have been adapted from stories planned for the unmade Season 27, and introduced a new companion for the Seventh Doctor, a young safecracker named Raine Creevy, played by Beth Chalmers. They were released monthly from January–April 2011 are as follows. The character of Raine makes her debut as an adult in "Crime of the Century", but appears as a newborn baby in "Thin Ice"; Beth Chalmers plays Raine's mother in that story. <section begin=series2 /><section end=series2 /> <section begin=special2011 /><section end=special2011 /> This third batch of stories features three stories with the Fifth Doctor, Nyssa and Tegan Jovanka, followed by three stories with the Sixth Doctor and Peri, followed by dramatic readings of a First Doctor and Second Doctor story to round out the final two releases of the series. This series was released in October 2011 – September 2012. <section begin=series3 /><section end=series3 /> A fourth series of stories was released in 2013, featuring one story with the First Doctor, two with the Second Doctor and one with the Third Doctor, featuring the first Third Doctor lost story ever released. The series was released September–December 2013, and the first three stories are connected because they were all originally by Brian Hayles. <section begin=series4 /><section end=series4 /> Two further stories were released in November 2019. The first features the Fifth Doctor, Tegan, and Turlough in an unmade story from Season 21 while the second features the Sixth Doctor and Peri in a fourth story from the unmade 1985–1986 series. <section begin=series5 /><section end=series5 /> <section begin=series6 /><section end=series6 /> 

Catocala lineella, the lineella underwing, little lined underwing or steely underwing, is a moth of the family Erebidae. The species was first described by Augustus Radcliffe Grote in 1872. It is found in North America from Ontario and Quebec south to Florida west to Texas and north to Ohio. It was considered to be a subspecies or even a synonym of "Catocala amica" for a long time. The wingspan is 35–40 mm. Adults are on wing from July to August. The larvae feed on the leaves of "Quercus" species. 

Impalila (sometimes spelt Mpalila) is an island at the far eastern tip of Namibia, bounded on the north by the waters of the Zambezi river and on the south by the Chobe River. It is home to some 2500-3000 people in 25 small villages, including Tswanas (from Botswana) and Subia people (from Namibia). Impalila is usually accessed from Kasane in Botswana, on the other bank of the Chobe River. There is a Namibian customs and immigration post on the island. There is also an airport with a 1,300 metre runway, used for charter flights to bring tourists to the various lodges on the island. The airport is a relic of a military base used in the 1980s by the South African Defence Forces, strategically positioned within sight of Botswana, Zambia and Zimbabwe. The Namibian Navy has refurbished the base and is now operated by Namibian Marine Corps. Impalila is a led by a chief who has the power to give land to the people in need. Impalila Island is known by the Big Three Figures or persons of which all are late. The three people were Kachele, Simasiku "Six" and Libalamwe. Those heroes divided Mpalila into three portions. Each one got his portion of land which he could allocate to the community members who requested land for settlement and cultivation. Libalamwe was known for his charms of flying using pumpkins and could reach any place first and faster than his subjects who would have travelled two or three days before by car to Bukalo (Subia Tribal Authority Head-quoter)or Katima Mulilo. 

Heurist is an online database designed for digital research objects including bibliographic records, web bookmarks, historical events, document annotations, images, contemporary stories and other data which is rich in text and classification data, and often heterogeneous. Heurist was originally designed by Ian Johnson (from 2005) and developed by the (now disbanded) Arts eResearch unit (AeR) at the University of Sydney. It continues to be developed within the Faculty of Arts. It was released as Open Source software in May 2013 (version 3.1.0), originally on Google Code, later moved to GitHub, and a free web service for low-demand academic databases is available at https://heuristplus.sydney.edu.au/ - other free services are listed in the project web site (http://HeuristNetwork.org). Heurist was developed to overcome two problems identified as common to researchers in the Humanities (and others): It aims to tackle the first issue by providing a web service supporting the on-demand creation and configuration of new databases through a web interface. It aims to tackle the second issue by allowing the storage and interlinking of a wide variety of research data, notes, annotations and digital attachments in a single shared database, while providing individual ‘views’ on this data and workgroup-owned and private areas for research in progress. Heurist is written in PHP and JavaScript, on top of a fixed MySQL data structure (all Heurist databases have the same underlying structure, as the logical structure of the database is encoded directly in the data). Entities/record types, fields and terms are defined within the database rather than being hardcoded in the software or database structure. Heurist uses a key-value pair approach linked to a primary data table instantiating typed entities, allowing variant data structures and repeating value fields. Relationships between entities are implemented as a relationship record which is no different from any other record type, apart from a few special behaviours. Heurist has the following field types: Heurist uses Smarty templates for user-defined reporting, and generates maps and timelines directly in the interface for any items which have geographic or time fields; embedding code is provided to generate the same reports /maps / timelines in a web page using JavaScript or within an iframe. Network diagrams and schema diagrams are available in Heurist version 4. Other functions include a bookmarklet for capturing web references, WYSIWYG formatted text and threaded discussions within records, user and workgroup tags, personal and shared saved searches, search expansion rules to pull in related records, workgroup ownership of records, group notifications, and blogging. There is a Zotero bibliography synchronisation function. For developers there is a JavaScript programming API - HAPI - allowing direct read and write access to Heurist records independent of internal storage structure, and functions for transforming XML output to other forms using XSLT stored in records within the database. Heurist source code is available under GNU GPL from the GitHub repository at https://github.com/HeuristNetwork/heurist and can be installed on any LAMP server, including virtual servers in the NeCTAR Research cloud, Amazon AWS and virtual servers from most ISPs.. Heurist was conceived as a digital knowledgebase for managing heterogeneous and relatively unstructured data, in small to medium collections of (often textual) data such as those typically found in the Arts and Humanities, and in personal research spaces. It is not suitable for large, structured, homogeneous, numerical datasets typical of the Sciences. Heurist allows management of information with spatial and temporal components. Spatial components include the ability to enter georeferenced points, polygons etc. directly into an editor, as well as the ability to upload spatial data such as KML and Shapefiles. Spatial data is displayed on a map view within the database. Temporal components include the ability to enter dates as calendar dates, ranges, fuzzy dates or radiocarbon dates, with confidence levels. Dates are displayed on a timeline within the database. Heurist has been used to provide a database for research for a number of PhD research projects, primarily in Humanities disciplines, including Archaeology, Classics and Art History. Heurist was also used as the database to manage the cultural heritage information for nomination of the World Heritage Site Bahrain Pearling Trail, which was successfully inscribed on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 2012. Cultural Heritage Managers at the former Ministry of Culture in Bahrain (now the Bahrain Authority for Culture & Antiquities) used Heurist to collate, analyse, manage and assist with the vast array of data associated with the nomination. This data included spatial polygons defining the properties to be included in the World Heritage Site, details of the properties (including timelines and history of ownership), details of people associated with the properties (including anthropological interviews with informants), associated photographs, documents and plans, including architectural plans and legal documents. These items were all cross-referenced with intuitive relationships defining how they were associated with each other. This database was referred to in the Nomination file, accepted by UNESCO in 2012. 

Karl Wilhelm Jacob Haas (27 December 1900 – 7 July 1970, London), musician, musicologist and conductor, was born in Karlsruhe, Germany, where he studied at the Classical College, then at the Universities of Munich and Heidelberg. His first work was at the Dumont Theatre in Düsseldorf; then as Music advisor for Karlsruhe and Stuttgart radio stations. He escaped Nazi persecution of Jews and settled in Britain in 1939. He worked as Music Director of Old Vic in Bristol, where he composed incidental music and stage scores. Karl was an enthusiast of Baroque music and a player of the viola d'amore. He edited works of Cherubini, Boccherini, Dittersdorf, Handel, Haydn and others. In 1941 he founded the "London Baroque Ensemble", which had its public debut in 1943, and continued to play until 1966. Members of the Ensemble between 1952 and 1954 included Sidney Sutcliffe, Terence MacDonagh, Natalie James (aka Natalie Caine), Roger Lord on oboe; Frederick Thurston, Jack Brymer, Gervase de Peyer, Basil Tschaikov on clarinet; Cecil James, Paul Draper, Edward Wilson on bassoons; James O'Loughlin on contra-bassoon; Dennis Brain, Neill Sanders, Ian Beers on horns; Vivian Joseph (cellist) on cello; and James Merritt on double-bass. They have accompanied keyboardists Lionel Salter, Charles Spinks and George Malcolm in works of J. S. Bach and C. P. E. Bach. They made a number of recordings of Handel, Bach and Boyce,some produced by George Martin. According to Basil Tschaikov, Karl Haas was a fine instrumentalist but a poor conductor. This was evidenced when playing the Richard Strauss Sonatina No 2 for the BBC on two occasions, as the second was by far the better performance. The difference was attributed to his taking a fall after the first, which left his arms in a sling. A recording containing Dvořák's Serenade in D minor Op. 44, Mozart's Serenade No. 11 in E flat, K.375 and Serenade No. 12 in C minor, K.388/384a is available on the Testament label. Other recordings of the London Baroque Ensemble were made on the Westminster label, now part of Deutsche Grammophon, Parlophone, Decca and Pye. He had been working on a book "300 Years of Military Music" at the time of his death. 

Norman Crider (August 29, 1938, in Lordsburg, New Mexico – August 19, 2009, in Indianapolis) was a baton-twirling champion and proprietor of the Ballet Shop near Lincoln Center in New York. He also owned a gallery-bookshop on Madison Avenue where in 1977 he held an acclaimed exhibition on prima ballerina Anna Pavlova. In 1957 Crider performed with batons in an ice show at the Conrad Hilton Hotel in Chicago, at which time he began to study ballet. Two years later he developed a nightclub act combining ballet and baton-twirling which he took to Europe. He taught twirling to French and Italian schoolchildren for the next eight years and was awarded the Order of Cultural Merit and Philanthropy by the French government. Besides the Ballet Shop, Crider founded the Antiques Center of America, on the East Side of Manhattan, and owned shops in the Trump Tower and La Boutique Fantasque at Rockefeller Center. After the Ballet Shop closed in 1996, he opened a shop in Winter Park, Florida, which was located next to The Morse Museum of American Art, before moving to Indianapolis.

The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings () is a 2011 action role-playing video game developed by CD Projekt Red, based on "The Witcher" series of fantasy novels by Andrzej Sapkowski. It is the sequel to the 2007 game "The Witcher" and the second main installment in "The Witcher"'s video game series. It was released for Microsoft Windows, Xbox 360, OS X, and Linux. The player directs the actions of Geralt of Rivia, a monster hunter known as a Witcher (Warlock). The fantasy world in which his adventures take place owes much to Polish history and Slavic mythology. The game was both a critical and commercial success, selling over 1.7 million copies by May 2012. The third installment in the series, "", was released in May 2015. The gameplay of "The Witcher 2" is a marked departure from that of its predecessor. Combat, for instance, is much more complex, with additions in the form of abilities to lay traps and aim and throw ranged weapons. The protagonist, Geralt, has an improved offensive and defensive arsenal, with a wide range of melee and ranged weapons, armor, bombs, traps, and secondary weapons such as hatchets and shovels. Upgrades are divided into four distinct paths: an initial training path, which includes generalized upgrades for various core abilities and must be invested in before the other paths can be accessed; swordsmanship, which improves Geralt's sword-fighting abilities; alchemy, which includes perks such as reducing the negative effects of potions; and magic, which improves Witcher Signs. "The Witcher 2" includes a stealth mode in certain parts of the game, where players must remain undetected as they make their way to a certain objective. Players have the option of stunning enemies if Geralt manages to get behind them, but the player may choose to take a less subtle approach and engage the guards in combat. The player controls Geralt of Rivia, who is one of the few remaining witchers – enhanced and trained humans with special powers who hunt monsters for a living. "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings" contains many different paths and storylines, along with multiple endings. At the start of the game, Geralt is in prison under suspicion of assassinating Foltest, the king of Temeria. The head of the Temerian special forces, Vernon Roche, interrogates Geralt and learns the story that led from Geralt being Foltest's right-hand man to a prisoner. Prior to and during the events of The Witcher, Foltest had a secret relationship with a baroness named Maria Louisa La Valette, which led to two children, Anais and Boussy. Some time after Geralt saved Foltest from a witcher assassin (at the end of "The Witcher"), Foltest attempted to claim his children and bring them to live with him in Vizima. Maria was not willing to give up the children, and Foltest waged a war to claim them. Geralt succeeded in escorting Foltest to his children, but an unknown assailant kills Foltest before disappearing, leaving Geralt the only suspect. After the interrogation, Roche decides that Geralt is innocent and aids him in escaping the prison. The two, along with sorceress Triss Merigold, go in search of the kingslayer. The trio arrives in the trading town of Flotsam and is ambushed by Iorveth, a rebel elf. It appears to the group that a witcher, believed to have assassinated King Demavend of the neighboring country of Aedirn, is in league with the rebels. Geralt saves his old friends, the bard Dandelion and the dwarf Zoltan Chivay, from being hanged in the city square. With the help of sorceress Síle de Tansarville, Geralt kills a Kayran, a giant monster that is disrupting the town's trade routes. Geralt discovers that Loredo, the ostensibly Temerian commander of the town, is intending to sell the town to King Henselt of Kaedwen. He also discovers that the kingslayer, a witcher known as Letho, means to betray Iorveth and convinces the elf of the truth. As Geralt and Iorveth confront Letho, Roche arrives with an armed force. The player chooses between assisting Iorveth or Roche, thus setting the path of the second chapter. Regardless of the choice, Letho kidnaps Triss and forces her to teleport both of them to Aedirn. If Geralt assists Iorveth, the pair sail to upper Aedirn. There, they become embroiled in a rebellion against King Henselt of neighboring Kaedwen, and they assist the rebel forces. Geralt completes three missions: formulating a poison antidote for rebel leader Saskia, determining Triss's whereabouts (captured by spies from the empire of Nilfgaard and taken to Loc Muinne), and lifting a battlefield curse that is preventing the rebels from defending Vergen, the rebel's base of operations. The rebels defeat King Henselt's army, and Henselt is forced to acknowledge Saskia's terms. Geralt discovers Saskia is a dragon taking human form, but she is under mind control by her advisor, the sorceress Philippa Eilhart. When Philippa teleports Saskia and herself to Loc Muinne, Geralt and Iorveth follow. If Geralt assists Roche, Roche has Geralt assassinate Loredo for treason. Geralt and Roche sail to upper Aedirn. There, they also become embroiled in the rebellion against King Henselt, but assist the king instead of fighting against him. Geralt discovers an insurgency in the Kaedweni army: loyalists who are convinced Henselt is conspiring with the empire of Nilfgaard. Geralt completes three missions: determining Triss's whereabouts (captured by a diplomatic delegation from Nilfgaard and taken to Loc Muinne), lifting a curse on King Henselt, and lifting a battlefield curse that is preventing the king from marching on the city of Vergen. Geralt defends Henselt from two witcher assassins and assists Detmold the mage and royal advisor to King Henselt in necromancy ritual to discover they are in league with Síle de Tansarville, who has already fled to Loc Muinne with fellow sorceress Philippa Eilhart and entranced rebel leader Saskia in tow. Roche is revealed to be plotting against Kaedwen, and Henselt executes most of Roche's men in retaliation. As Henselt assaults Vergen, Geralt defeats Henselt's personal guard, and either allows Roche to murder Henselt in revenge (which causes a civil war in Kaedwen) or convinces him to spare the king. Geralt and Roche then go to Loc Muinne, on the trail of Triss and Philippa. Geralt arrives at Loc Muinne with either Iorveth or Roche, depending on whom he assisted previously. The mages have called a meeting to establish a new magical ruling body known as the Conclave, and all royal leaders are at Loc Muinne. Philippa Eilhart and Síle de Tansarville intend to use the meeting to establish their own power, with the still-entranced Saskia as leverage. If Geralt arrives with Iorveth, he must choose between rescuing Triss or rescuing Philippa, who is the only person capable of lifting the spell from Saskia but who was captured and blinded by the king of Redania. If Geralt arrives with Roche, he must choose between rescuing Triss or rescuing the kidnapped Princess Anais of Temeria. Depending on the choice, the mage-royal meeting is interrupted when Nilfgaardian forces arrive with Letho, who reveals the sorceresses' entire plot, or if Triss is rescued – regardless of whom Geralt assisted – she reveals the sorceresses' plot instead. The meeting is interrupted again by Saskia in dragon form, who is still under mind control by Philippa. Geralt chases down Síle, who attempts to use her megascope (a magical teleporter) to escape. However, Letho had sabotaged the megascope, in which Síle becomes stuck. Geralt can either rescue Síle or do nothing, in which case Síle is torn to bits. Finally, Geralt duels Saskia, after which he can kill her, let her live, or (if he rescued Phillipa earlier) break the spell over Saskia's mind. If Triss was rescued, the Conclave is restored and the mages work to seal Loc Muinne. If Triss was not rescued, a bloody pogrom of magic users occurs in Loc Muinne and throughout the Northern Kingdoms. Geralt finally confronts Letho, who reveals a Nilfgaardian plot to destabilize the Northern Kingdoms. After hearing Letho's story, Geralt can either let him go or duel him to the death. Geralt then reunites with Triss and either Iorveth or Roche, and sets off south. A concurrent plot of the game is Geralt's attempts to recover lost memories from his previous life, learning more about his lover Yennefer, and the mythical Wild Hunt. The post-credit scene reveals a wood gathering peasant witnessing a Nilfgaardian invasion. "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings" was announced on 18 September 2009. CD Projekt Red developed a proprietary engine, the REDengine, for the game, unlike the first installment, which ran on a modified version of BioWare's Aurora Engine. The game incorporates the Havok physics engine. "The Witcher 2" features a branching dialogue system with full voice acting, which was cast, directed, and recorded in London, England. The developers said that the game would have 16 different endings, although that was later clarified as 16 "states of the world" by the game's end. The game drew from influences such as "Demon's Souls", "Heavy Rain", and "". CD Projekt Red released the first gameplay video on 25 March 2011, showcasing different methods with which a player could complete a level. Another gameplay video was revealed at Gamescom 2011, displaying the game's many characters and settings. An Xbox 360 version was announced on 2 June 2011, with CD Projekt Red confirming that it would be released by the end of the year. However, on 1 August 2011, the Xbox 360 release date was pushed back to the first quarter of 2012 to give the team "more time expanding and polishing certain elements of the gameplay" and to allow the developers time to deal with legal issues surrounding distribution rights for the game. On 14 April 2011, CD Projekt Red announced during their CDP Days 2011 Spring Conference that retail copies of the game would feature SecuRom digital rights management (DRM). However, the protection would still allow for infinite installations on an infinite number of PCs, with the ability to play on up to five PCs at any one time. It was confirmed that the game would feature no censorship between regions. "The Witcher 2" was also distributed through several digital distribution services such as Steam and CD Projekt Red's own service GOG.com. The version sold on GOG.com was the only version that did not have any DRM at release. On 3 May 2011, Bandai Namco Entertainment confirmed that the Australian release of the game would be modified to meet the MA15+ rating. The edit specifically relates to a side quest in which Geralt is offered sex as a reward for completing the quest. The Australian version sees Geralt decline the offer automatically. Three weeks prior to this announcement, the game was removed from the Australian Steam store, causing outrage amongst the Australian gaming community. Additionally, CD Projekt Red's digital distribution service GOG.com announced that the price of the Australian version would be increased due to licensing issues, but that customers could still pre-order the game for its original price 17 hours before the change. On 30 June 2011, it was announced that THQ would be the distributor of the game for Western Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and the Middle East. On 8 July 2011, Bandai Namco sued CD Project, accusing CD Projekt of breaking its contractual obligations with the publisher. On 8 December 2011, Bandai Namco won the suit, and CD Project Red's publishing agreement with THQ was canceled. "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings" was released for PC on 17 May 2011 at retail stores and digital distribution services such as GOG and Steam. UK supermarket chain Tesco released the console version of the game on Friday 13 April 2012 – four days ahead of the scheduled release date – and were asked to pull the game off the shelves until the original release date. GOG promoted the game by reducing the price of "The Witcher" a week before the sequel's release. They encouraged players to import their save files from the first game to the second. Steam offered three promotional "The Witcher 2" items for "Team Fortress 2". These were a hat of hair, a sword, and a necklace, which were limited to the game's Scout class. The May 2011 issue of the Polish version of "Playboy" featured the half-naked character Triss on the cover. In Russia, publishers 1C Company released a real-life nude calendar with copies of the game. When American President Barack Obama visited Poland in May 2011, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk gave him several gifts, including the Collector's Edition of "The Witcher 2". On 27 January 2012, CD Projekt Red announced an "Enhanced Edition" of "The Witcher 2" via its sister company GOG.com. It was released on 17 April 2012 on the Xbox 360 and on Microsoft Windows via Steam and GOG.com. All existing owners of "The Witcher 2" received free upgrades to the Enhanced Edition, and could pre-load the update starting 11 April 2012. All new copies on PC and Xbox 360 shipped with the additional content on board. "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings" - Enhanced Edition added over 10GB of new content, including four hours of gameplay, arena mode, new tutorial, 36 minutes of cinematics including a new intro created by Platige Image and an outro, as well as a host of fixes to gameplay and the interface. "The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings" received generally favorable reviews. It has won over 50 awards for best graphics, best adaptation or use of a license, best story, best PC game, best RPG, and Game of the Year. Critics praised combat mechanics, customization, graphics, environments, immersion, and storytelling. "PC Gamer" felt that combat mechanics and the game's ending were the weaker points of the game. 1UP's Tom Chick gave the game a glowing 'A' rating and cited its "rich graphics that don't have to be flashy, complex challenging combat, and superlative low-fantasy writing". The game garnered some perfect scores, with "GamePro" saying that ""The Witcher 2" embodies everything that's good about PC development, and everything that makes it, in my mind, the best platform out there." "Game Informer" gave the game a "platinum score" and mentioned that "the brilliant dark fantasy adventure is just as good on console" as it was on PC. A major source of contention about the game is the difficulty of the combat, especially during the game's first few hours. Some sources such as Eurogamer have praised the difficulty of the prologue, explaining "[the game] treats you not as a player... but as an adult, free to make your own mistakes and suffer a plot in which not everyone gets what they deserve". The game was also criticized for what Rock, Paper, Shotgun characterized as gratuitous nudity, especially in the topless scene of the character Maria Louisa La Valette, who is said to show "brazen breasts" while being threatened with torture, her breasts sexualizing a scene that should be gravely serious. Other critics felt the scene was simply being realistic, in that a woman in the real world who is about to be tortured would probably have bare breasts. In June 2014, the game garnered mainstream media coverage when United States President Barack Obama mentioned the video game in his speech in Poland. He said: The last time I was here, [Polish Prime Minister] Donald [Tusk] gave me a gift, the video game developed here in Poland that's won fans the world over, "The Witcher". I confess, I'm not very good at video games, but I've been told that it is a great example of Poland's place in the new global economy. And it's a tribute to the talents and work ethic of the Polish people as well as the wise stewardship of Polish leaders like Prime Minister Tusk. "The Witcher 2" had reportedly sold more than 940,000 copies by August 2011, a sales rate that CD Projekt Red had projected. Of the 940,000 copies sold, 200,000 were online sales (digital sales). Additional statistics for online sales were reported in November 2011. Direct2Drive, Impulse, and Gamersgate's combined sales were a total of 10,000 units. GOG sold 40,000 copies. Within the same time period, 200,000 copies of "The Witcher 2" were sold on Steam. By May 2012, the game had sold 1.7 million copies. By February 2013, the combined sales of the game and its predecessor exceeded 5 million. By March 2014, "The Witcher" series has sold 7 million copies of both games. By September 2014, the series reached 8 million copies. "The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt" was announced by CD Projekt Red on 5 February 2013, and was released on 19 May 2015 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.

Pale () was an ancient Greek city in ancient Cephalonia. In 435 BCE Pale supported Corinth against Corcyra by sending four ships. Its territory was called Paleis (Παλείς). Its site is located near the modern Lixouri. 

Phara () was an ancient Greek city located in the region of Acarnania. The only ancient source that mentions the city is the "Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax", which lists the πὸλις (polis) Φαρά between Leukada and Ithaca. Hansen and Nielsen place it in Leukada and identify the settlement with the current Pyrgi. Others note that Pseudo-Scylax orders Phara after Leukada and if he had wanted to classify it as a Leukadian "polis", he would have said the island had two "poleis". Thus, Phara could be one of the small islands between Leukada and Ithaca or be located on the coast of Acarnania in the "perea" of Leukada. If this interpretation of the text of the "Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax" is accepted, it would have to be classified as an unlocated polis of Acarnania. 

Phytia (), or Phoeteiae or Phoiteiai (Φοιτεῖαι), or Phoetiae or Phoitiai (Φοιτίαι), was a town in the interior of ancient Acarnania, situated on a height west of Stratus, and strongly fortified. It lay on the road from Stratus to Medeon and Limnaea. After the time of Alexander the Great it fell into the hands of the Aetolians, together with the other towns in the west of Acarnania. It was taken by Philip V of Macedon in his expedition against Aetolia in 219 BCE; but the Aetolians, doubtless, obtained possession of it again, either before or after the conquest of Philip by the Romans. It is mentioned as one of the towns of Acarnania in a Greek inscription found at the site of Actium, the date of which is probably prior to the time of Augustus. In this inscription the ethnic form Φοιτιάν occurs. Its site is located near modern Ag. Georgios, formerly Porta. 

Pronnoi (), also known as Pronesus or Pronesos (Πρωνῆσος), was one of the four towns of Cephallenia, situated upon the southeastern coast. Together with the other towns of Cephallenia it joined the Athenian alliance in 431 BCE. It is described by Polybius as a small fortress; but it was so difficult to besiege that Philip V of Macedon did not venture to attack it, but sailed against Pale. Livy, in his account of the surrender of Cephallenia to the Romans in 189 BCE, speaks of the Nesiotae, Cranii, Palenses, and Samaei. Now as we know that Proni was one of the four towns of Cephallenia, it is probable that Nesiotae is a false reading for Pronesiotae, which would be the ethnic form of Pronesus, the name of the town in Strabo. Pronnoi or Pronesus was one of the three towns which continued to exist in the island after the destruction of Same. Its site is located near Poros, Cephalonia. 

Same () was a Greek city in ancient Cephalonia. 

Torybeia () was a city in ancient Acarnania. It is known mainly through epigraphic evidence. Mention is made of the appointment of theorodokos of Torybeia, about the year 356/5 BCE to receive the "theoroi" of Epidaurus and also an inscription dated to around 330 BCE to accommodate those of Argos. It was one of the cities belonging to the Acarnanian League around 272 BCE. Its site is tentatively located near the modern Komboti. 

Hyporeiae or Hyporeiai () was an ancient Greek town located in the region of Acarnania. Its exact location is unknown, although it has been suggested that it should be located in the east of Acarnania, in the border area with Aetolia. Hyporeiae is known through two epigraphic testimonies beginning with a mention of the appointment of the town's theorodokos in circa 356/355 BCE to receive the "theoroi" of Epidaurus. Also, the town's name also appears in a 4th-century BC funerary inscription from Athens. 

Ithaca, Ithake, or Ithaka () was a Greek city on ancient Ithaca. 

Alyzeia () or Alyzia (Ἀλυζια), was a town on the west coast of ancient Acarnania. According to Strabo it was distant 15 stadia from the sea, on which it possessed a harbour and a sanctuary, both dedicated to Heracles. In this sanctuary were some works of art by Lysippus, representing the Labours of Heracles, which a Roman general caused to be removed to Rome on account of the deserted state of the place. The remains of Alyzia are still visible in the valley of Kandili. The distance of the bay of Kandili from the ruins to Leucas corresponds with the 120 stadia which Cicero assigns for the distance between Alyzia and Leucas. Alyzia is said to have derived its name from Alyzeus, a son of Icarius. It is first mentioned by Thucydides; in 375 BCE, a naval battle was fought in the neighbourhood of Alyzia between the Athenians under Timotheus and the Lacedaemonians under Nicolochus. The Athenians, says Xenophon, erected their trophy at Alyzia, and the Lacedaemonians in the nearest islands. We learn from the "Periplus of Pseudo-Scylax" that the island immediately opposite Alyzia was called Carnus, the modern Kalamos. Its site is located near the modern Kandila, Xiromero.

Vincenzo Lauro (1523–1592) was an Italian papal diplomat, bishop of Mondovì, and Cardinal from 1583. He was born at Tropea. His career was forwarded by Cardinal Pier Paolo Parisio and Cardinal Nicola Gaddi. He became a diplomat while acting for Cardinal François de Tournon in 1552. He became bishop of Mondovì in 1566 and in the same year was sent on a papal mission to Mary, Queen of Scots.

Lee Ji-eun (; born May 16, 1993), known professionally as IU (), is a South Korean singer-songwriter and actress. She signed with Kakao M (formerly LOEN Entertainment) in 2007 as a trainee and debuted as a singer at the age of fifteen with her album "Lost and Found". Although her follow-up albums, "Growing Up" and "IU...IM", brought mainstream success, it was after the release of "Good Day" (), the lead single from her 2010 album "Real", that she achieved national stardom. "Good Day" went on to spend five consecutive weeks at the top position of South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart, and in 2019 it was ranked number one on "Billboard" magazine's 100 Greatest K-Pop Songs of the 2010s. With the success of her 2011 albums, "Real+" and "Last Fantasy", IU established herself as a formidable force on the music charts of her native country and further cemented her girl next door image as Korea's "little sister". 2011 also saw her first foray into songwriting with "Hold My Hand", which was written for the television series "The Greatest Love". IU's third full-length album release, "Modern Times" (2013), showcased a more mature style that marked a departure from her earlier girlish image, with several tracks reaching the top 10 positions on Gaon Digital Chart. While her subsequent releases, including albums "A Flower Bookmark", "Chat-Shire", and "Palette," continued to deviate from the mainstream K-pop style, IU retained her dominance on music charts. "Chat-Shire" marked the first time she is credited as the sole lyricist and composer of her own album. IU has released a total of four studio albums and nine extended plays in her career, scoring three number-one albums and twenty-four number-one singles on the Gaon Music Charts. One of the best-selling solo acts in the group-dominated K-pop industry, she has been included on "Forbes" magazine's annual Korea Power Celebrity list since 2012 and reached a peak ranking of number three that year. "Billboard" recognized IU as the all-time leader of its Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart with the most number-one songs and the artist who has held the number-one position for the most number of weeks. According to a Gallup Korea survey, she was the most popular idol and artist among South Koreans in 2017. Aside from her music career, IU has ventured into hosting radio and television shows, as well as acting. Following her supporting role in teen drama "Dream High" and minor appearances in several television series, IU starred in "You're the Best, Lee Soon-shin", "Pretty Man", "The Producers", "", "My Mister", "Persona" and "Hotel del Luna". IU was born Lee Ji-eun () on May 16, 1993, in Songjeong-dong, Seoul, South Korea. At an early age, IU became interested in pursuing a career in the entertainment industry and began attending acting classes. Soon after her elementary school years, her family's financial situation deteriorated, and they eventually moved to the nearby Uijeongbu in Gyeonggi Province. She and her younger brother lived apart from their parents in a studio room with their grandmother and cousins for over a year in conditions of great poverty. IU had little contact with her parents over this period of time but felt reassured under her grandmother's care. During her middle school years, IU found her passion for singing and decided to become a singer after being applauded for a performance she gave at her school's sports competition. She attended 20 auditions but failed all of them, and was also scammed by fake entertainment companies. IU used to train at Good Entertainment with Uee, Yubin, Heo Ga-yoon, and Jun Hyoseong. After signing with LOEN Entertainment in 2007, she moved to Bangbae, Seoul. Despite the prospect of her being put into a girl group, she made her solo debut in 2008 after ten months of training. Due to her living conditions at the time, IU stated that she "loved being at the studio", where she could eat as much as she wanted and had a place to sleep. Prior to her debut, LOEN coined her stage name "IU", deriving it from the phrase "I and You" to symbolize the unifying force of music between people. Her burgeoning career led to her decreased attendance at school and declining grades, with the exception of Korean literature. After graduating from Dongduk Girls' High School in 2012, IU decided not to pursue post-secondary education in tandem with her singing career. After training for ten months, IU released "Lost Child" () as her first single. She performed the song live for the first time on the music program "M! Countdown" on September 18, 2008, making it her debut performance as a professional singer. Regarding the performance, IU recalled the crowd had hurled insults at her and though she initially felt discouraged by it, she now considers it a beneficial experience. "Lost Child" is the lead single from her debut extended play "Lost and Found", which was released on September 24, 2008. For the album, IU was awarded the "Rookie of the Month" by South Korea's Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism in November 2008. However, the album did not do well commercially. During an interview in 2011, IU said, "My first album failed, but I'm grateful for that. If I had become successful as soon as I made my debut, I wouldn't appreciate my staff members and the popularity that I'm enjoying now." On April 23, 2009, IU launched her first studio album, "Growing Up", with the lead promotional single, "Boo". She began her album promotion the next day, performing "Boo" on KBS2's "Music Bank". The song was noted for its stark contrast in musical style to "Lost Child", which was described as a "heavy" and "dark" ballad compared to the 1980s "retro sound" of "Boo". Deemed as a "strategic" transformation, the dance choreography, stage costume and hairstyle shown in live performances were used to emphasize her youthfulness and project a "cute" image. Although it drew a favorable response from the public, IU, who was fifteen years old at the time, admitted that the image made her feel awkward. The song was nominated as a number-one contender on the popular music program, "Inkigayo". Along with several songs from "Lost and Found", "You Know" () was also featured in "Growing Up"; a new rock-style arrangement of the song was released as the follow-up single to "Boo". Towards the end of 2009, IU released her second extended play, "IU...IM". She began promoting its lead single, "Marshmallow" (), on music programs across the three major television networks from November 13, 2009. The song was described as "saccharine" with a style that was a hybrid of the rock-and-roll of the 1960s and "French pop". Recalling the performances, IU stated on a 2013 episode of "Happy Together" that she disliked having to wear the girlish costumes and hairstyle fashioned for the song promotions. The performances were well-received and were once again labelled "cute", reminiscent of reviews for "Boo". In addition to her album releases in 2009, IU participated in her first soundtracks via two MBC television dramas, "Strike Love" () and "Queen Seondeok" (). She also collaborated with artists such as Mighty Mouth and The Three Views on their albums. As her popularity began to rise, IU made more frequent appearances on variety shows, performing on "Star Golden Bell", "Kim Jung-eun's Chocolate" and "You Hee-yeol's Sketchbook". Her acoustic covers of other artists' songs such as Girls' Generation's "Gee", Super Junior's "Sorry, Sorry", and Big Bang's "Lies" () featured in these live performances gained tremendous interest online. In late 2009, she became a TV presenter for the first time, hosting a weekly music chart show on Gom TV, while appearing as a fixed guest on multiple radio programs such as "Kiss the Radio", "Volume Up", MBC Standard FM's "Starry Night" and MBC FM4U's "Best Friend Radio". On June 3, 2010, IU released "Nagging" (), a duet which she recorded with 2AM's Lim Seul-ong. The single debuted at twelve on the Gaon Digital Chart and shot up to number-one position the following week, where it remained for three weeks. Written by Kim Eana and composed by Lee Min-soo, the pop ballad duet was used as one of the theme songs for the second season of the variety show, "We Got Married". The song was popular on music programs, where it won the Mutizen award on "Inkigayo" and was placed first on "Music Bank". Soon after, IU released "Because I'm a Woman" (), one of the theme songs of MBC's historical drama, "Road No. 1" (). The song peaked at number six on the Gaon Digital Chart. IU's collaboration with Sung Si-kyung on "It's You" () for his album, "The First", debuted at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. IU's third EP, "Real", was released on December 9, 2010. Produced by Jo Yeong-cheol and Choi Gap-won, "Real" debuted at number four on the Gaon Album Chart. The lead single, "Good Day" (), reunited IU with lyricist Kim Eana and composer Lee Min-soo after "Nagging", whom she would work with again on the lead singles of her next two studio albums. The uptempo song, as explained by Kim Eana, is about "a shy girl who is nervous about expressing her feelings to the boy she likes." During the album's promotional period, IU also topped the charts on the music programs "M! Countdown", "Music Bank," and "Inkigayo". Both Kim Eana and Lee Min-soon considered the main factors of the song's success to be the use of the word "oppa" () in the chorus, as well as the three high-pitched notes that IU sings in semitone increments during the climax of the song. In addition to receiving praise for her vocal abilities, IU's fan base also expanded to a more varied demographic as compared to other K-pop groups. To maintain public visibility, IU joined the cast of the variety show, "Heroes", which aired from July 18, 2010 to May 1, 2011. Speaking fondly of the show, IU recalled the camaraderie she built with the other regular cast members despite the hectic two-day shooting schedules which only allowed them two-three hours of sleep. Shortly after joining "Heroes", IU was cast in teen drama "Dream High" (). Filming ran from December 2010 to February 2011, during which time she remained committed to "Heroes" and her existing promotions for "Good Day". In her first acting role, IU played Kim Pil-sook, a shy and overweight school girl who dreams of becoming a professional singer. Admitting that she was doubtful about her readiness to take on acting, IU remarked that she gained confidence in learning that the part would require singing and would later describe the experience as a tremendously enjoyable one. For the series' soundtrack, she released the single, "Someday", which achieved number-one position on the Gaon Digital Chart on the week of January 30 – February 5, 2011. By the end of 2011, the single had sold 2,209,924 digital copies and is one of IU's best-selling singles for a soundtrack. A follow-up extended play to "Real" was released on February 16, 2011 with the title, "Real+", containing three songs. The lead single, "Only I Didn't Know" (), was composed by singer-songwriter Yoon Sang with lyrics written by Kim Eana. Yoon Sang wrote the song for IU after spotting her momentary sad expression on a television broadcast. The ballad's tone was a departure from her more recent releases, with IU describing it as "dark", "sad" yet "nostalgic", which is closer to her music preference. The song performed well commercially, debuting at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart. IU took on various side-projects after the end of "Dream High". On March 10, 2011, IU performed as the opening act for British singer-songwriter Corinne Bailey Rae's first solo concert in Seoul with two songs, before joining Bailey Rae during her performance of "Put Your Records On". Bailey Rae, whom IU described as her role model, said of IU, "It's incredible that her voice is so soulful even though she's young." In the same month, IU was appointed as one of the new hosts of the music program, "Inkigayo", a position which she held until July 2013. For K.Will's extended play album, "My Heart Beating", she starred in two of his music videos alongside Lee Joon and No Min-woo. In May 2011, IU recorded her first self-composed song, "Hold My Hand" (), for the romantic-comedy television series, "The Greatest Love" (). Since it was the first time she had written a song not for herself but at the behest of the drama's producers, IU found the experience difficult as she had to match the drama's cheerful tone. The song peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and sold 2,031,787 digital copies in 2011. Between May and July 2011, IU took part in the reality ice-skating competition series, "Kim Yuna's Kiss & Cry", as a celebrity contestant until she was eliminated in the eighth episode. During this time, she also participated in "" but eventually withdrew after recording one episode due to her overwhelming schedule. On her wide-ranging activities in entertainment, IU remarked that while singing, acting and variety are all difficult, she finds variety to be the most tiring. IU's second studio album, "Last Fantasy", was released on November 29, 2011 in two editions, a regular retail version and a special storybook edition, of which only 15,000 copies were produced. The "Korea JoongAng Daily" described the album as one that would "suit all kinds of musical tastes and fans", while "Billboard" noted the "cinematic feel" of the album as set by the opening track, "Secret" (). Produced by Jo Yeong-cheol, whom IU worked with on "Real", the album contains collaborative works with singer-songwriters such as Yoon Sang, Lee Juck and Ra.D. The total number of download sales made from the album's tracks exceeded 10 million within the first two weeks. Eight out of the album's thirteen songs debuted in the top ten on the Gaon Digital Chart, while the album debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart. The main single, "You and I" (), became IU's most commercially successful single with almost 5.5 million digital copies sold by the end of 2012. It topped the Gaon Chart as well as the newly established "Billboard" Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart at the time of release. Shortly before the release of "Last Fantasy", IU signed with EMI Music Japan (now part of Universal Music Japan) as a precursor to her entry into the Japanese market. A selection of her previously-released songs was compiled into an extended play album called "I□U" that was released in Japan on December 14, 2011. As promotions for "Last Fantasy" and its main single "You and I" continued into 2012 in South Korea, IU began preparations for her debut in Japan by playing two shows at the Bunkamura Orchard Hall in Shibuya, Tokyo to an audience of about 4,000 people on January 24, 2012. She performed six songs including her debut single, "Lost Child", and the Japanese version of "Good Day" with the support of either a live orchestra or her own acoustic guitar accompaniment. Subsequent to the concert, both "Good Day" and "You and I" were released as new singles in Japan with translated lyrics to moderate success. According to Japan's Oricon Singles Chart, the single album of "Good Day" sold 21,000 physical copies on the first week of release with the single debuting on the chart at number six. On the Billboard Japan Hot 100, "Good Day" peaked at number 5. "You and I" peaked at number four on the Oricon Singles Chart and number eleven on the Billboard Japan Hot 100. In support of her Japanese single releases, IU toured five cities Tokyo, Sapporo, Nagoya, Osaka and Fukuoka in a mini-concert series called "IU Friendship Showcase - Spring 2012". IU embarked on her first solo concert tour, titled "Real Fantasy", in June 2012. She played shows in six different cities across South Korea, starting with two shows in Seoul. The opening shows on June 2–3 were sold out within 30 minutes of the tickets going on sale on April 17. It was reported that 43.8% of ticket purchasers were between the ages of 20 and 29, while 71% were male, which was considered uncommon for a K-pop concert. The tour continued to Ulsan, Jeonju, Suwon, Busan and Daegu, before returning to Seoul with two encore concerts that ended on September 23, 2012. Guest performers included Ra.D, Lim Seul-ong and Lee Seung-gi. Due to her commitments towards preparing for her first solo tour, IU was unable to make broadcast promotions for her fifth Korean extended play album, "Spring of a Twenty Year Old" (), which was released on May 11, 2012. The album, named to celebrate IU turning the Korean age of 20, contains three songs with the lead single being "Peach" (). Self-composed by IU, "Peach" peaked at number two on the Gaon Digital Chart and number three on the Billboard K-pop Hot 100. The second single released from the album was "Every End of the Day" (), which topped the Gaon Digital Chart for two weeks and the Billboard K-pop Hot 100 for four weeks. In place of the usual 4–5 minute music video that usually accompanies a single release, a 26-minute-long documentary-style music film was shot in Venice and Burano and released alongside the album, featuring both "Peach" and "Every End of the Day". IU returned to Japan on September 17, 2012 to perform one show, titled "IU Friendship Special Concert - Autumn 2012", at the Tokyo International Forum to a crowd of over 5000 people. With Sunny Hill as a guest act, IU performed a mixture of her own songs and covers of Korean and Japanese songs such as "Juliette" by Shinee, "Friend" by Anzen Chitai and "Aishiteru" from the "Natsume's Book of Friends" anime series. Live recordings of "Friend" and "Aishiteru" from the event were later released as promotional digital singles. Nearing the end of her "Real Fantasy" tour and promotions in Japan, IU resumed her hosting duties on "Inkigayo" after taking a three-month leave due to concert commitments. She also became the host of MBC's short-lived television quiz show, "Quiz Show Q", alongside Park Myeong-su and Sun Bom Soo. On December 29, IU hosted the 2012 "SBS Gayo Daejeon", an annual music program, alongside Bae Suzy and actor Jung Gyu-woon. She was selected by the program's producer for her MC skills that she demonstrated on "Inkigayo". For her accomplishments over the past year, IU won two awards at the 2012 Seoul Music Awards; "Last Fantasy" was named Record of the Year, while she was among the ten musical acts who were awarded the Main Prize. At the Korean Music Awards, "Good Day" was named Song of the Year and Best Pop Song, while she was named Female Musician of the Year (Netizen Vote). "Billboard" magazine named IU as one of the hottest musicians under 21 years old in 2012 for her "unique charm and undeniable hits [that] have made her into a bona fide superstar". IU started 2013 by taking on her first leading role in a television series, playing the title role in "You're the Best, Lee Soon-shin" (). The 50-episode weekend series ran from March 9 to August 25 on KBS2. Her character was described as a "loser" who is seemingly average in every way except for her daring and bright personality, which helps her to overcome hardships. Despite the worries of casting someone who is better known as a singer in the role, director Yoon Sung-sik decided to cast IU after seeing her performance in "Dream High" and thought that she suited the image he had envisioned for the character. Her co-stars Go Doo-shim and Lee Ji-hoon, as well as the production crew, praised her performance, especially during emotional scenes. As the series progressed, IU's performance garnered positive critical reviews despite early reservations shown about her casting, with the viewership ratings reaching a peak of 30.8%. She was nominated for the Excellence in Acting Award (Best Actress in a Serial Drama) at the 2013 KBS Drama Awards. For the drama, she released a recording with her co-star Jo Jung-suk of her self-composed duet, "Beautiful Song" (), which was not included on the official soundtrack. In the same period, IU released her second Japanese extended-play album, "Can You Hear Me?", featuring her first original Japanese songs. Two tracks from the album were released as singles; "Beautiful Dancer" and "New World" peaked at number 66 and 76 respectively on the Billboard Japan Hot 100, ranking significantly lower than her Japanese-translated versions of "Good Day" and "You and I", which were top 10 releases. "Rolling Stone Japan" gave the album a positive review, highlighting "Beautiful Dancer" and "Truth" as stand-out tracks. In an interview with Oricon, IU recalled how shocked and touched she was to receive "Beautiful Dancer" and "Truth" from R&B producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. Her next Japanese single, "Monday Afternoon", was released on September 11, 2013, debuting at number 27 on Billboard's Japan Hot 100 chart and number 9 on Japan's Oricon Daily Chart. Almost two years after "Last Fantasy", IU released her third studio album, "Modern Times", on October 8, 2013. It was described to be "a big shift from the young singer's K-pop roots" that showcased a "more mature and sophisticated sound and image" than her previous work. IU composed and wrote two out of the album's 13 tracks, which ranged from swing to jazz, bossa nova, Latin pop and folk genres. The diversity of jazz styles and the mix of collaborative tracks were highlighted in reviews by "Billboard", "The Korea Herald" and "Seoul Beats". "Billboard" described the album as one that features "throwback vibes with a modern twist a la Christina Aguilera's "Back to Basics" record", with IU proving to have "musical sensibilities well beyond a typical 20-year-old". "The Korea Herald" wrote: "... vintage sounds and modern effects are put together artfully, forming a fresh but familiar compilation of songs. "Modern Times" has a distinct carefree feel that is reminiscent of jazz during the Roaring Twenties." Also giving a positive review, "Seoul Beats" wrote: "With its jazzy, big band sound, IU provided a breath of fresh air to the K-pop scene... The album's real strength is how seamlessly the tracks flow together." "Modern Times" debuted at number one on the Gaon Album Chart, while seven of its tracks achieved top ten positions on the Gaon Digital Chart with the lead single, "The Red Shoes" (), placing in the number one position. Similarly, the album debuted number four on "Billboard"s World Albums Chart, with twelve tracks in the Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart. On the second week of her promotional activities for "Modern Times", IU decided to join the romantic-comedy series "Bel Ami" (). She played the "quirky" and "playful" role of Kim Bo-tong, a carefree girl in her twenties who has had an unrequited crush on the male protagonist since high school. The series aired from November 20, 2013 to January 9, 2014 on KBS2 and suffered from low ratings. For her performance, IU was nominated in the Outstanding Korean Actress category at the 2014 Seoul International Drama Awards. In support of "Modern Times", IU held her second solo concert series with three shows which took place in November 23–24, 2013 at Kyung Hee University's Peace Hall in Seoul and ended on December 1, 2013 at KBS Hall in Busan. Promotions for "Modern Times" progressed into 2014 with IU performing in Hong Kong for the first time in a solo concert. A repackaged version of "Modern Times", titled "Modern Times - Epilogue", was released on December 20, 2013 with two additional tracks: "Friday" () and "Pastel Crayon" (). Her self-composed track, "Friday", was originally intended to be included in "Modern Times" but was later released as the lead single of "Modern Times - Epilogue". Described as a "mid-tempo, acoustic swing-pop number", "Friday" held the number one position on the Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart for two weeks after release. The lead single was successful on the Gaon Digital Chart, peaking at number one, and became the 10th best-selling digital single of 2014. Its popularity was also demonstrated by its simultaneous number one ranking on all three of Korea's major music programs without any live performances. IU released her sixth Korean extended-play album and first cover album, "A Flower Bookmark" (), on May 16, 2014. The album contains seven renditions of tracks that hailed from the 1980s and 1990s with a mixture of genres that included ballad, dance, folk and rock. The album came about at the request of fans and due to the positive feedback she had previously received for her cover songs. Three tracks debuted in the top ten of the Gaon Digital Chart on the week of release, with the main single, "My Old Story" (), ultimately peaking at number 2. However, it was her collaboration with Kim Chang-wan on the remaking of his 1984 track, "The Meaning of You" (), that became the best-selling track from the album and also her best-selling single of 2014. The album was well received by "The Korea Times" for providing "a pleasant, calming respite from the mainstream music of today's times", and praised IU for her reinterpretations: "For every track, IU keeps a careful balance between preserving the song's original sentiments and altering the original with her own color and arrangements." "Billboard" highlighted the track, "Pierrot Smiles at Us" (), as the "most ambitious tune she tackled" and one that proved her diversity as a singer. Furthermore, "A Flower Bookmark" was listed at number three on "Billboard"s Best K-Pop Albums of 2014 and was nominated for Album of the Year at the 2014 MelOn Music Awards. IU's wish to conduct a more intimate and smaller scale concert was fulfilled in her third solo Korean concert series, "Just One Step... That Much More". The concert series took place over eight nights from May 22, 2014 to June 1, 2014 at Sogang University's Mary Hall, which had a capacity of 450 people. Tickets to all eight shows were sold out within 10 minutes of release on May 7, 2014. As well as playing the keyboard for the first time on stage, IU performed all the seven songs from "A Flower Bookmark" among various new arrangements of her earlier songs. Guest acts included Kim Jong-hyun, Jung Yong-hwa, Hwang Kwanghee, Kim Bum-soo, Lim Seul-ong, Jo Jung-suk, Ha Dong-kyun and Akdong Musician. Profits made from the concerts were donated to the victims of the Sewol Ferry Disaster. Two months after her solo concerts ended, IU made her debut performance in the United States at the KCON music festival held in Los Angeles on August 9–10. IU was the only female act to perform on the first day of KCON and for the event, she performed "The Red Shoes", "You and I", "Friday" and "You Know". In their review, "Los Angeles Times" opined that IU had a "sprightly stage presence, and as a solo female singer, she's breaking the molds for K-pop stardom." The 2014 KCON event was attended by approximately 42,000 people. IU expressed her anxiety performing at the event in her interview with "Billboard": "I always get nervous when I'm performing at international shows... I think I need to study English for the next visit to the U.S. It's suffocating not being able to communicate with fans..." Throughout 2014, IU's collaborations with other artists spawned top-ten hits: "Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms" (), the debut single of High4, which featured IU as lyricist and vocalist, reached number one on both the Gaon Digital Chart and Billboard Korea K-Pop Hot 100; "Anxious Heart" (), recorded by Ulala Session and IU in 2012 but was released more than a year later out of respect for the death of Ulala Session's lead vocalist, peaked at number four on the Gaon Digital Chart; "Sing for Me" (), which was released as part of god's eighth studio album, peaked at number nine on the Gaon Digital Chart; "Sogyeokdong" (), written by Seo Taiji for his "Quiet Night" album and sung by IU in October 2 release version, debuted at number four on the Gaon Digital Chart; and "When Would It Be" (), a duet with her labelmate Yoon Hyun-sang for his debut album, "Pianoforte", which also peaked at number nine on the Gaon Digital Chart. After "Not Spring, Love, or Cherry Blossoms" topped "Billboard"s Korea K-Pop Hot 100 chart, IU became its "all-time chart leader" with five number-one songs and the artist who has spent the most number of weeks at number one since the chart's creation in September 2011. In 2015, two years after her last acting role, IU starred alongside Kim Soo-hyun, Cha Tae-hyun, and Gong Hyo-jin in "The Producers" (), which was named as one of the most anticipated TV series of the year in South Korea. She played Cindy, a diva-like singer who decides to participate in a variety show to improve her public image. Analysing her character's perceived icy demeanor, IU commented that she could relate to her character's "biting attitude" and how similar her character was to herself. The series and IU's portrayal of Cindy were met with lukewarm reviews at the premier but both the viewership and critical response improved over the course of the series, peaking at 17.7% viewership for the last episode. She performed two songs in character, "Twenty Three" and "Heart" (), both of which were later included as bonus tracks on her 2015 album, "Chat-Shire". While she wrote the lyrics for both songs, she also composed the music for "Heart", which was released as a digital single on 18 May. "Heart" topped the charts upon its release and went on to become the tenth best-selling digital single of 2015 in South Korea. "Heart" was among a slew of K-pop songs used by South Korea's Defense Ministry in its propaganda broadcasts to North Korea during the two countries' tense standoff in August 2015, with the aim of advertising the "South Korean youth culture". Through "The Producers", IU's popularity in China soared—reportedly receiving offers for several projects from Chinese companies. After the completion of "The Producers", IU participated in the biennial music festival event hosted by the variety show, "Infinite Challenge", in which each participating singer-songwriter is partnered with one of the six hosts to create a song for the festival. The preparation process and festival event were aired over the course of seven episodes. She was partnered with Park Myeong-su, with whom she recorded and performed the song, "Leon" (as inspired by the film ""). The live performance event on August 13, 2015 attracted an estimated crowd of 40,000 at Alpensia Ski Jumping Stadium as shown in the final episode, which achieved a 21.1% viewer's rating on its August 22, 2015 airdate. Subsequent to the final episode's broadcast, "Leon" was released along with the other songs from the festival as a digital track and on the official festival album. "Leon" reached number one on all of South Korea's music charts upon release. IU's seventh Korean extended play album, "Chat-Shire", was released digitally on October 23, 2015 prior to its physical release on October 27, 2015. IU asserted greater creative control on the album, writing the lyrics for all seven tracks (as well as the physical album's two bonus tracks) and composing the music for five tracks either individually or collaboratively. She was also credited as the album's executive producer. The lead single, "Twenty-Three" (), topped the national music charts upon release with several of the album's tracks also ranking in the top ten. The album reached a peak position of number four on "Billboard"s World Albums chart. "Billboard" described the album as a "must-hear" release, containing "some of [IU's] most personal music yet", and named "The Shower" () as its stand-out track. "Seoul Beats" also highlighted the "personal quality" showcased in many of the album's tracks and praised IU's "growing maturity as an artist" and her willingness to experiment musically. Despite positive critical reviews and success in the music charts, the album became controversial due to the lyrics of "Zezé" and the audio samples used in the bonus track "Twenty Three" (not to be confused with the similarly titled lead single). On November 4, the Korean publisher of the novel "My Sweet Orange Tree", from which IU drew inspiration for the song "Zezé", stirred debate in the entertainment industry on freedom of interpretation when it leveled criticisms at IU for her interpretation of the five-year-old protagonist as a "sexual object". Two days later, IU issued a public statement: "I did not mean to turn Zeze into a sexual object... but I realize that my lyrics have offended many, and for this I apologize." On November 10, the publisher released an apology for its failure to acknowledge "diversity of interpretation." For the bonus track "Twenty Three", voice samples from Britney Spears' "Gimme More" were allegedly used without permission. "Billboard" ranked "Chat-Shire" the sixth best K-pop album of 2015, explaining that "IU knows how to take the sounds of yesterday and update them to stunning results." Prior to the release of "Chat-Shire", LOEN announced that IU would not be partaking in broadcast promotions for the album and would instead be holding a national tour from November to December 2015. The Chat-Shire national tour began in Seoul on November 21 and continued to Busan, Daegu and Gwangju, before returning to Seoul, where it ended on December 31. In the midst of her concert tour for "Chat-Shire" in South Korea, IU also increased promotional activities in Hong Kong, China and Taiwan, hosting fan-meetings and concerts in various cities as well as releasing a compilation album, "Smash Hits", to the Taiwanese market on December 11, 2015. Containing 16 previously-released songs, "Smash Hits" was published by Warner Music Taiwan and topped the K-pop album chart of Taiwan's leading online music store, KKBOX, on its first week of release. Tickets to her concert of January 10, 2016 in Taiwan also sold out within two minutes of going on sale. Towards the end of 2015, IU hosted SBS's annual end-of-year music program, "Gayo Daejeon", with Shin Dong-yup. The program's producers said of their host selection, "IU has been deeply acknowledged for her musical talents, moving beyond the image of 'Korea's cute younger sister'." For her accomplishments in 2015, "Ize" listed IU as one of the "Persons of the Year", while "GQ Korea" named her as the "Woman of the Year". In September 2016, IU starred as the lead role, Hae Soo, in "", a Korean adaptation of the Chinese novel "Bu Bu Jing Xin". IU published her fourth studio album, "Palette", on April 21, 2017, of which she served as the primary lyricist and executive producer. Three singles from the album were released earlier; the lead single of the same name featuring G-Dragon from Big Bang; as well as two pre-release tracks "Through the Night" and "Can't Love You Anymore". "Palette" debuted atop "Billboard" World Albums chart (a first for the singer) and topped local charts in both album sales and downloads. "Billboard" highlighted and complimented IU's stronger creative control on the album, saying that it successfully allowed listeners to learn more about her and ultimately paving way for greater success both in Korea and internationally. "Palette" was a commercial success, with all three singles from the album peaking at the top of the Gaon Digital Chart, with the main single, "Palette" spending a total of two weeks at number 1. However, it was her first pre-release track, "Through the Night" that became the best-selling track from the album and also her best-selling single of 2017. "Palette" was also critically acclaimed and received multiple accolades, including "Best Pop Album" at the 15th Korean Music Awards, "Album of the Year" at the Melon Music Awards, and "Record of the Year (Album)" award at the 27th Seoul Music Awards; IU herself was awarded the Best Female Artist at the Mnet Asian Music Awards. The album also earned IU a "Best songwriter" award at the Melon Music Awards, a "Lyricist of the Year" award at the 7th Gaon Chart Music Awards and a "Producer of the Year" award for herself and her production team. IU also received the "Song of the Year" award at the 32nd Golden Disc Awards for her hit song "Through the Night". "Billboard" magazine listed "Palette" at number six on its list of "Best K-Pop Songs of 2017", explaining "The mellow-dy belies a topsy-turvy world of self-satire, idiosyncratic sound effects and throwbacks to older eras." "The New York Times Magazine" also featured "Palette" on its list of "25 Songs That Tell Us Where Music Is Going", making IU the only Asian artist to make the list while appreciating IU's ability as a singer-songwriter to project authenticity in K-pop. Furthermore, Billboard ranked "Palette" the best K-pop album of 2017, explaining that "An album as impressive and sonically diverse as "Palette" proves why injecting an artist's personal experiences into their music can lead to their greatest work yet." During the promotional period of "Palette", IU joined the reality program "Hyori's Homestay". IU released her second cover album, "A Flower Bookmark 2" on September 22, 2017. Like its predecessor, the album contained renditions of tracks released from the 1960s to the early 2000s with a mixture of genres such as folk, retro, ballad and nu-disco. Prior to the album's release, a single titled "Autumn Morning" was released without prior notice on September 18 to mark the singer's ninth anniversary. It topped all seven local music charts upon release. The album was originally intended to include Kim Kwang-seok's track "With the Heart to Forget You", however, due to recent events surrounding the singer's family, it was ultimately decided that the track would be removed out of respect for the ongoing investigations. She later went on a tour in various cities around Korea as well as Hong Kong from November to December 2017 to promote the album. IU was also featured in the title song, "Love Story", of Epik High's ninth album, "We've Done Something Wonderful", which was released on October 23, 2017. The song achieved a "Perfect All-Kill", topping the daily and real time charts of all 6 major Korean music sites. Gallup Korea ranked her the most popular K-pop artist of 2017 (she previously topped the ranking in 2014) and also the most popular K-pop idol of the year. In March 2018, IU starred in tvN's "My Mister", playing the character Lee Ji-an. The series was commercially and critically successful with peak audience ratings of 7.3% making it one of the highest rated Korean dramas in cable television history, and positive reviews for IU's performance. IU then contributed her vocals to Zico's "Soulmate", which was released on July 23, 2018. Upon release, the single topped the daily and real time charts of all 6 major Korean music sites and claimed the number one position on the Gaon Digital Chart. To commemorate her tenth debut anniversary, IU released a single titled "Bbibbi" in October 2018. The music video was released alongside the single on October 10, 2018. The following day, Kakao M confirmed that "Bbibbi" had surpassed one million unique listeners on Korea's largest music site Melon only 16 hours after its release. They stated that by 23 hours in, it had already broken the previous 24-hour unique listener record set by her duet "Leon" with Park Myung-su in 2015. "Bbibbi" went on to record a total of 1,462,625 unique listeners in the first 24 hours of its release. The single peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, and at number five on the "Billboard"'s World Digital Songs Chart. "Billboard" magazine listed "Bbibbi" at number 87 on its list of "Best Songs of 2018", explaining "The single not only comments on IU's experiences in the public life, but it doubles as a universal empowerment anthem, knowing and acknowledging one's worth and personal rights." The single was also listed at number 4 on Billboard's list of "The 20 Best K-pop Songs of 2018". IU began her first Asian tour, "IU 10th Anniversary Tour Concert", on October 28, 2018. Two months later, IU featured on Kim Dong-ryul's "Fairytale" which peaked at number four on the Gaon Digital Chart. On April 11, 2019, IU made her film debut in the Netflix anthology series "Persona". She portrayed different characters in each of the four short films which were written and directed by the critically acclaimed directors Lee Kyoung-mi, Yim Pil-sung, Jeon Go-woon and Kim Jong-kwan. It was the sixth most popular program on Netflix in Korea in 2019. During the summer, IU starred in the fantasy mystery drama "Hotel del Luna", written by the Hong Sisters. She also sung one of the songs on the soundtrack, "Happy Ending". The drama was a commercial success, recording the highest ratings in its timeslot throughout its run. IU was set to release her ninth extended play, "Love Poem", on November 1. However, she decided to postpone the EP's release to November 18 following Sulli's death. The eponymous lead single was released as planned and quickly achieved a certified all-kill. The single peaked at number one on the Gaon Digital Chart, and at number nine on "Billboard"'s World Digital Songs Chart. On November 2, 2019, IU began her second Asian tour, "Love Poem", in Gwangju. Nearly 90,000 fans attended her two-month tour during which she visited 10 cities. On November 25, "Billboard" published their list of the "100 Greatest K-pop Songs of the 2010s", with IU's "Real" album single "Good Day" ranked at number one. On January 3, 2020, it was announced that IU would star in the film "Dream" alongside Park Seo-joon. Directed by Lee Byeong-heon, it will tell the story of people participating in the Homeless World Cup. For the first time in nine years, IU participated in a soundtrack album with the song "Give You My Heart" for the hit romantic comedy "Crash Landing on You". Released on February 15, 2020, it topped the music charts Melon, Genie, Bugs and Soribada less than three hours after its release. The song debuted at number 71 on South Korea's Gaon Digital Chart for the chart issue dated February 9–15, 2020 rising and reaching number one on the following week. On May 6, 2020, IU released the single "Eight" featuring and produced by BTS's Suga. It follows IU's previous singles "Twenty-three" (2015) and "Palette" (2017) which together comprise her "coming-of-age" series. The song's title derives from the last digit of the Korean age "twenty-eight" of both singers. On June 19, 2020, IU released the song "Into the I-LAND" as the signal song for Mnet's survival reality show "I-Land". Since her debut in 2008, IU has received over 200 nominations, winning over 70 of them. She has won eleven Melon Music Awards, nine Gaon Chart Music Awards, five Korean Music Awards, five Mnet Asian Music Awards, five Seoul Music Awards, and three Golden Disc Awards. The singer has also won several awards for her work as an actress, earning the title of "Best New Actress" at the 2014 KBS Drama Awards for her performance in "You're the Best, Lee Soon-shin". IU has received five Daesang awards, also known as grand prize awards, from various award shows. This includes three Daesang awards from the Melon Music Awards. Daesang awards are the most significant awards given in the Korean music industry. In 2012, IU was identified as one of the most influential people in South Korea by the "Forbes" Korea Power Celebrity list, and has since been mentioned five times. Additionally, IU was honoured at the 2015 Pop Culture & Arts Awards, held by the Korean Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism, being recognized for her influence and success on the music industry. Since February 2012, IU has been an ambassador for South Korea's National Police Agency in their anti-bullying campaigns in schools; she was made an honorary member of the police force in 2013 before being promoted to an honorary senior police officer in 2014 for a two-year term. In 2015, and later in 2018, IU donated ₩100,000,000 (about US$88,000) to the Green Umbrella Children's Fund, requesting it be used to assist underprivileged children. She has also volunteered for the organization. IU later established a scholarship at her high school alma-mater in 2016 after regularly donating there for the past several years. The scholarship, dubbed the "IU Scholarship", is designed to help four graduates from families needing financial aid. In 2018, IU provided ₩20,000,000 (about US$18,000) in financial aid to five college students, helping to cover their room and board. That same year, IU participated in the Ice Bucket Challenge, an Internet challenge designed to promote Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) awareness. Her philanthropy efforts earned her a mention in Forbes' Asia's 2019 Heroes of Philanthropy: Catalysts For Change, being the youngest to have made the list. During COVID-19 pandemic, the Korean Medical Association said that IU donated 3,000 pieces of medical protective clothing, worth 100 million won ($82,185), and about 4,600 cooling vests, worth 100 million won ($84,000) for nurses, according to the Korean Nurses Association. IU is one of the highest-earning celebrities in South Korea, with endorsements attributing to a proportion of her income. Over the course of her career, she has endorsed various products that ranged from electronics to clothing and cosmetics. After consecutive hit single releases and increased television appearances in 2010, her growing popularity led to her first endorsement deals with Crown Confectionery's MyChew candy, Crown Bakery and clothing brand Y'sb. Also among her first endorsements were video games. Although considered unusual for a female singer, IU has been involved with video game endorsements since 2010. She served as a VJ on MBC Game's "Star for You" and an announcer during player introductions for Global StarCraft II League in 2010. She also helped to promote the Global StarCraft II League in 2011 by performing at the finals. She was chosen for her "simple and innocent image" to endorse the massively multiplayer online role-playing game "Alicia: The Story of My Horse and I", in November 2010. In addition to the game's advertisements, IU also participated in its soundtrack. In 2012–13, IU was a spokesmodel and in-game model for NCsoft's "" video game. She was also part of Nexon's promotions for "Dungeon Fighter Online" in 2014. Soon after the release of "Real" in December 2010, IU became the face of Samsung Anycall and Samsung Galaxy S II for Samsung Electronics, and the endorsement model for clothing brands Unionbay Sportswear and Le Coq Sportif. She also appeared in commercials for South Korea's largest wireless carrier SK Telecom, Namyang Diary's Yogurt Bulgaris brand, petroleum and refinery company S-Oil, and retail chain Homeplus. She has been the face of fast-food restaurant chain Mexicana Chicken since 2011. In 2012, she became the endorsement model for clothing brands G by GUESS with Yoo Seung-ho and Elite with Infinite. She was appointed as the face of SK Planet online store, 11st, and appeared in commercials for The Saem cosmetic brand as well as Nongshim's Shin Ramyun and Hoo Roo Rook products (with Park Bo-gum). Along with Yim Si-wan and Hwang Kwanghee, IU starred in a three-part drama commercial for Samsung Wave 3, titled "20, Start of a Wave". Additionally, IU was chosen to be the ambassador for Expo 2012 held in Yeosu. Following the release of "A Flower Bookmark" in May 2014, IU was featured in commercials for the Chinese cosmetic brand, Qdsuh. Subsequently, she participated in Sony Korea's promotional campaign for its MDR series headphones with You Hee-yeol and continued to be Sony Korea's representative and model for its audio products in 2015. In November 2014, soju production company HiteJinro announced that IU had become the spokesmodel for its Chamisul brand. Her contract renewal was announced in December 2015. In 2014–15, IU became an endorsement model for Sbenu footwear along with Song Jae-rim. IU once again became an endorsement model for Unionbay Sportswear in 2015 with Lee Hyun-woo and was appointed as the new face of cosmetic brand ISOI. Both Unionbay and ISOI sponsored "The Producers", a 2015 television series in which IU had a leading role, through product placement. Selected filmography 

Criticisms of the labor theory of value affect the historical concept of labor theory of value (LTV) which spans classical economics, liberal economics, Marxian economics, neo-Marxian economics, and anarchist economics. As an economic theory of value, LTV is central to Marxist social-political-economic theory and later gave birth to the concepts of labour exploitation and surplus value. LTV criticisms therefore often appear in the context of economic criticism, not only for the microeconomic theory of Marx but also for Marxism, according to which the working class is exploited under capitalism. Adherents of neoclassical economics, the mainstream school of economics, employ the theory of marginalism, which holds that the value of any good or service is measured by its price. While Marxian surplus value can't be measured, the utility of the "last" bought consumption good determined by its marginal utility, in satisfying a specific consumer's wants should therefore be concerned as a complete absolute essence, where politics, social constructions, ideologies and culture (such as the media, fashion, and consumerism) should be considered nonexistent. While Marx emphasizes profit maximisation (under the premise that a capitalist would only be concerned with profit), neoclassical economists view the maximisation of utility at the individual or societal level (i.e. in capitalism individuals are understood as altruist concerned solely in providing people with what they want). Proponents of the labor theory of value (LTV) would reply that in capitalism the price of a good is not simply measured by its usefulness but by its price. It depends on a pre-existing set of relations of distribution. These relations of distribution in turn rest on a set of relations of production, which determine how consumers "earn" money, capitalists "earn" profits, workers wages, landlords rent and so on. Consequently, the price of an object depends not only on its usefulness, but on the amount of money different consumers would spend on it, i.e. their different effective demands. It is unclear how if at all this differs from a wealth effect on demand that results directly from the individual's utility maximization problem. In microeconomics, this utility maximisation takes place under certain constraints, these are the available numbers of factors of production, for instance, labor (as with Marx profit maximisation takes place under the constraint of available production techniques and the wage rate). In fact, the ultimate restriction is time. Households divide their time (24 hours a day) into leisure time and time for work. Time for work is to make money to buy goods for consumption. The household chooses that amount of leisure time and (via working time) that amount of consumption goods that maximises its utility level. With Marx, working time is not based on a free decision of households, but the outcome of a class struggle between workers and capitalists, the former trying to decrease, the latter to increase working time. Further, all this does not take account of effects of the accumulation process. With Marx, there is a tendency of equalisation of rate of profit in the accumulation process, which leads to prices of production. If the price of a commodity is above its price of production, then capitalists in that sector earn a super profit (a rate of profit above the average rate of profit of the economy as a whole). As a result, capital is attracted to that sector, production increases, and prices fall until the super profit has been competed away. The resulting prices of production are via transformation from labor values into prices based on labor times. According to marginalism, value is subjective (since the same item—leisure time, consumption goods—have a different marginal utility to different consumers, or even to the same consumer under different circumstances) and therefore cannot be determined simply by measuring how much labor is necessary to produce an item. In the Pareto optimum, on the other hand, the exchange relations between commodities are not only determined by their marginal utility, but also by the marginal productivity of the factors of production available. This means that in marginalism commodities exchange at the marginal amount of labor necessary to produce them. In this sense, an LTV, or, more precisely, a value theory of marginal labor inputs, holds. However, this applies to all factors of production and also to marginal utility. Labor is nothing special. That these several value theories can hold all at the same time is made possible by marginal analysis. The Pareto optimum is defined as a situation where utility is maximised and at the same time all factors of production are employed most efficiently, leading to a situation, where all commodities exchange at their marginal utilities and at their - marginal - amounts of the different factors of production necessary to produce them. In other words, if empirically it was found out, that commodities exchange according to their marginally necessary labor inputs, this would confirm marginal theory. It would falsify Marx’s theory, because according to Marx these exchange ratios are determined by prices of production, which are generally different from the necessary labor inputs, the labor values. Implicitly, Marx is thus denying that capitalism is in a state of Pareto optimality. Opponents of Marxist economics argue that the labor theory of value is disproven as commodities may diverge from the average price of production. In his 1871 work "Principles of Economics", Austrian School economist Carl Menger writes: There is no necessary and direct connection between the value of a good and whether, or in what quantities, labor and other goods of higher order were applied to its production. A non-economic good (a quantity of timber in a virgin forest, for example) does not attain value for men since large quantities of labor or other economic goods were not applied to its production. Whether a diamond was found accidentally or was obtained from a diamond pit with the employment of a thousand days of labor is completely irrelevant for its value. In general, no one in practical life asks for the history of the origin of a good in estimating its value, but considers solely the services that the good will render him and which he would have to forgo if he did not have it at his command...The quantities of labor or of other means of production applied to its production cannot, therefore, be the determining factor in the value of a good. Comparison of the value of a good with the value of the means of production employed in its production does, of course, show whether and to what extent its production, an act of past human activity, was appropriate or economic. But the quantities of goods employed in the production of a good have neither a necessary nor a directly determining influence on its value. The Austrian economist Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk argued against both the Adam Smith labor theory of price and Marx's theory of exploitation. On the former, he contended that return on capital arises from the "roundabout" nature of production, which necessarily involves the passage of time. A steel ladder, for example, is produced and brought to market only if the demand supports the digging of iron ore, the smelting of steel, the machines that press that steel into ladder shape, the machines that make and help maintain those machines and so on. Roundabout processes, Böhm-Bawerk maintained, lead to a price that pays for more than labor value, and this makes it unnecessary to postulate exploitation to understand the return on capital. In contrast, Marx argued in "Capital" that it is not demand that creates, but labor that preserves the value of the commodities obtained prior to the actual process of production - in this case, the iron, steel and machines necessary to make the ladder: The worker is unable to add new labor, to create new value, without at the same time preserving old values, because the labor he adds must be of a specific useful kind, and he cannot do work of a useful kind without employing products as the means of production of a new product, and thereby transferring their value to the new product. [This] is a gift of nature which costs the worker nothing, but is very advantageous to the capitalist since it preserves the existing value of his capital. Thus, proponents of the LTV argue, without the necessary addition of human labor-power, the ore, steel and machines would not create any new value on their own, but would in fact gradually depreciate what value they originally possessed through the ravages of time and neglect. Once these materials are activated in the labor process, their values are simply transferred from one commodity to another with no increase. They claim that it is not the materials, but the labor-time present in a commodity that represents its mark-up in value over the course of its production. Böhm-Bawerk's positive theory of interest also argued that workers trade in their share of the end price for the more certain wages paid by the entrepreneur. Entrepreneurs, he claimed, have given up a safer wage-earning job to take on the role of entrepreneur. In other words, he claimed that profits compensated the entrepreneur for the willingness to bear risk and to wait to receive income. Böhm-Bawerk's essential argument that employers are compensated for shouldering some risk in paying their employees ahead of time, however, appears unable to explain how profit can be accumulated in cases where workers are reliant on commissions, tips and so on for their income, which are received only after they sell their services. However, Böhm-Bawerk's does provide such an explanation. In the context of a waiter earning tips, the waiter himself is not a wage-earner. The restaurant owner does not make of profit from the tips earned by the waiter. The waiter is essentially an entrepreneur, taking the risk that customers will sufficiently compensate him for the labor he provides, while the customers are under no legal obligation to do so. The waiter is making an investment of services in anticipation of future return from the customers. The waiter is compensated by an aggregate amount of earnings from tips that exceeds that labor value provided to the customers, thereby including a return on the waiter's investment. If the tips were not sufficient to provide this return on investment, then the waiter would rationally seek other employment, such as a wage-earning job with similar compensation that does not include the risk element or an entrepreneurial job with similar risk that provides a better return. Regarding other situations where the employer-entrepreneur does receive a profit from after the labor has been rendered (e.g. a salesperson who works on commission), the employer-entrepreneur may take risks other than paying a wage to the salesman, including: providing a salesperson with an office, cell phone and/or computer; paying for product training and marketing materials; paying for travel and lodging expenses; producing inventory in reliance upon future sales that may or may not be made by the salesperson. All of this comprises a potential for loss that accounts for the return on investment realised by the employer-entrepreneur. Nikolai Bukharin argued that Böhm-Bawerk's concept of roundaboutness was untenable in the context of the continuous, simultaneous production of a modern economy. The Austrian school, led by Eugen von Böhm-Bawerk, argues against the whole tradition of the LTV (see above) and prefers methodological individualism. Neoclassical economics also follows this lead  — and that of Jevons, Menger, and Walras — from the 1870s and discards the LTV in favour of General equilibrium theory, which determines prices based on the interaction of preferences, technology and endowments through supply and demand. Marx argues in "Capital": Some people might think that if the value of a commodity is determined by the quantity of labor spent on it, the more idle and un-skillful the laborer, the more valuable would his commodity be, because more time would be required in its production. The labor, however, that forms the substance of value, is homogeneous human labor, expenditure of one uniform labor power. The total labor power of society, which is embodied in the sum total of the values of all commodities produced by that society, counts here as one homogeneous mass of human labor power, composed though it be of innumerable individual units...The labor time socially necessary is that required to produce an article under the normal conditions of production, and with the average degree of skill and intensity prevalent at the time. Thus, according to Marx any labor power squandered during the production of a commodity, i.e. labor that is socially unnecessary, does not add value as value is determined by the average social labor. Robert Nozick has criticised the qualifier "socially necessary" in the labor theory of value as not well-defined and concealing a subjective judgement of necessity. For example, Nozick posits a laborer who spends his time tying knots in a piece of cord. The laborer does his job as efficiently as is humanly possible, but Marx would likely agree that simply tying knots in cords is not a socially necessary use of labor. The problem is that what is "socially necessary" depends entirely on whether or not there is demand for the finished product, i.e., the knotted cord. In this way, introducing the "socially necessary" qualifier into the labor theory of value simply converts the theory into a roundabout and imprecise description of supply and demand. Thus Nozick argues that there is no longer any labor theory of value but rather the notion of what makes labor time socially necessary is dependent upon supply and demand in the market. Dembinsky argues that the "labour value" metric as proposed by Marx was the main reason for many of the market inefficiencies as observed in Eastern Bloc planned economies. For the "labor value" concept to work, the society needs must be "perfectly known before production commences", the needs must not change in the meantime and the effect of production is required to actually satisfy society's needs, complying with the previously established plan. If any of these conditions is not satisfied, the economy is eventually forced to either allow users to determine their own value in use using market prices (second economy, NEP) or deny the users "the right to assign goods a value in use". According to Dembinsky, many of the declaratively Marxian economies were effectively left with an open and crucial question on how to actually assess the labor value, which is not clearly answered in Marx works. Most of them applied an ideologically safe "average labor time" model, which had however considerable negative influence on effectiveness by "discouraging marginal productivity gains". Another criticism is that socially necessary labour time needs to be able to be measured as a homogenous unit of labour, which can then be added up. If socially necessary labour time cannot be measured, then it is difficult to see how Marx's theory can be maintained, as the quantum that Marx viewed as underlying all of capitalism cannot actually be examined. Some critics of Marxism argue that its proponents have failed to find an adequate way to measure socially necessary labour time. It is often assumed that the LTV would apply in a socialist (or post-capitalist) society, though (purportedly at least) without the corresponding exploitation. However, Marx argued in his "Critique of the Gotha Programme": Within the co-operative society based on common ownership of the means of production, the producers do not exchange their products; just as little does the labor employed on the products appear here as the value of these products, as a material quality possessed by them, since now, in contrast to capitalist society, individual labor no longer exists in an indirect fashion but directly as a component part of the social labor. David Ramsay Steele expands on this: Numerous Marxist writers, from Marx and Engels down to Charles Bettelheim, have favoured employing units of labor-time for planning production under socialism. This proposal is often referred to as an application of the labor theory of value, though that usage is not in conformity with Marx's. The Marxian labor theory of value (LTV) is intended to explain the determination of prices under commodity production (this is occasionally denied, but see Steele 1986). In Marxian terminology, there can be no 'value' in post-capitalist society. Both the LTV and communist planning conceive of resource allocation being guided by quantities of labor-time. Yet the LTV as an explanation of market prices and the labor-time planning proposal are two distinct theories, which may stand or fall independently. If the LTV were the correct explanation of market prices, this in itself would not show that units of labor-time could be of any practical use in administration of communist industry. And if units of labor-time could effectively be employed for communist planning, this would not require that the LTV be the correct explanation of market prices. [...] According to Marx's theory, actual prices virtually always diverge from 'values' defined as units of labor-time. In Marx's thinking, after 1860, the relationship between 'value' and observed market prices is somewhat analogous to the relationship between 'mass' and 'heaviness', or between 'heat' and everyday awareness of temperature. Marx's 'value' is purportedly necessary to explain price, but it does not correspond to price or equilibrium price (often not even roughly) and therefore obvious disparities between value and price are not seen by Marx as refutations of his theory, though they are seen as contradicting the simple models employed in the early stages of expounding his theory in Volumes I and II of "Capital". The LTV is a theory of capitalist production, or generalised commodity production. However, there are commodities bought and sold under capitalism that have an 'imaginary' price even though they do not have a value. "Objects that in themselves are no commodities, such as conscience, honour and the like, are capable of being offered for sale by their holders, and of thus acquiring, through their price, the form of commodities. Hence an object may have a price without having value. The price in that case is imaginary, like certain quantities in mathematics. On the other hand, the imaginary price-form may sometimes conceal either a direct or indirect real value-relation; for instance, the price of uncultivated land, which is without value, because no human labor has been incorporated in it" ("Capital" Volume 1, Chapter 3, section 1). However the socially necessary labor theory of value only becomes inapplicable for uncultivated land when that land can never be productive no matter how much commercial labor is expended on it. Desert sand, gibber plains and icy wastes have very small land values because no commercial labor can be diverted from other uses to be usefully employed. In other cases, the price-form represents the indirect socially necessary labor that could be usefully employed: Marx stated that only labor could cause an increase in exchange value. Assuming that all labor is equal, this suggests that labor-intensive industries ought to realize a higher profit than those that use less labor. This contradicts the tendency, accepted by Marx, that rates of profit between industries should become equal. Marx explained this contradiction by the fact that in real economic life prices vary not randomly, but in a systematic way from values. The mathematics applied to the transformation problem—transformation of labor values into production prices—attempt to describe this (albeit with the unwelcome side consequences described above). Critics (following, for instance, studies of Piero Sraffa) respond that this makes the once intuitively appealing theory very complicated; and that there is no justification for asserting that only labor and not for example grain can increase value. Any commodity can be picked instead of labor for being the commodity with the unique power of creating value, and with equal justification one could set out a "corn theory of value", identical to the labor theory of value. Anarchist Robert Paul Wolff, despite identifying as a Marxist on economic matters, nevertheless offers such a critique, saying "By reproducing for corn [grain] or iron or coal, all the striking results that Marx derived concerning for labor, we have, it seems to me, raised questions about the foundations of Marx's critique of capitalism and classical political economy." However, there may be several problems with this criticism. The starting point for Marx's argument was as such: "What is the common social substance of all commodities? It is labor." It is not possible to view grain, iron etc. as common to all commodities, whereas the production of commodities is impossible without labor (while it can also be said that other commodities such as tools are required, they cannot be properly aggregated by value because they are specialised and disparate in nature and their values, relative to each other and to labor, depend on prices that in turn depend on their values; Sraffa (1960), for instance, aggregates them according to the labor required for their production). Marx identifies the substance of value as labor, which in his view is "not" a commodity (though "labor power" is). This was a necessary aspect for the substance of value Marx elaborates upon in "Capital" and "Theories of Surplus Value". Some supporters of the LTV, however, accept the thrust of the "corn theory of value" critique, but emphasise the "social" aspect of what Marx calls the "common social substance", arguing that labor power is unique as it is the only commodity not sold by capitalists but rather sold by the workers themselves, whose income tends to a minimum, because they have nothing else to sell. The surplus product is appropriated by the capitalists. Alan Freeman argues: "This is of course true of other commodities [than labor power] also; but other commodities do not walk around the market disposing of their income on an equal basis with their owners. The cost of labor power is determined "independently" of its capacity to make money for its purchaser. This, and no other reason, is why profit exists. If laborers were hired directly as slaves, robots, beasts of burden or servants, then whether or not labor time were the measure of value, surplus labor would not be extracted in the form of money profits but directly, like domestic labor." Albert Einstein, in his description of the LTV, argues similarly: "It is important to understand that even in theory the payment of the worker is not determined by the value of his product." Marx writes on this: “In the slave system, the money-capital invested in the purchase of labor-power plays the role of the money-form of the fixed capital, which is but gradually replaced as the active period of the slave’s life expires.” David Steele argues that Marx gives no good reason why labor should have a "privileged position in the determination of prices", when any other input could be used - machines, paper or even capital itself. Steele notes that commodities almost never have equal quantities of labor and that Marx's argument rests upon the assumption that when commodities are exchanged, they must have "something" in common and that something can be nothing but labor. Steele argues as such: [...] any input could be chosen as a creator of value [...] Thus a 'paper theory of value' would hold that prices were ultimately determined by values, defined as quantities of 'socially necessary paper' (measured in pounds weight). The organic composition of capital would be the ratio of non-paper means of production to paper, and it would be asserted that only paper created new value, and therefore surplus-value. The whole of "Capital" could be rewritten, substituting 'paper' for 'labor'. Exploitation of paper-owners would occur because they do not really sell their paper, but rather their 'paper-power'. Goods requiring no paper inputs would be regarded as having 'imaginary prices', just as Marx regarded salable goods which require no labor inputs. The same thing, of course, could be done with 'electricity', 'liquid', 'metal', or 'machines', or it could be done with 'capital' (constant capital, which would then have to be renamed variable capital), thus showing that the capitalist class produces all wealth and is exploited by other classes, especially the wholly unproductive working class, which contributes no capital and therefore no value. To provide support for Marx's theory, it is necessary to show "both" that prices can be mathematically derived from labor-values (the transformation problem) "and" to present a good argument why we would wish to do this - why the class of inputs known as 'labor' should be given this privileged position in the determination of prices. Steele thus refers to marginal theory, under which labor is just another input in the production process and therefore concludes that to say that capital exploits labor makes as much sense as saying "that labor exploits capital, or electricity exploits roofing tiles". Indeed, it has been argued that Marx never offered (despite promising to do so in Volume 3 of "Capital") a positive proof for his theory or an explanation for why labour-power is the only commodity that can create more value. Steele also argues that Marx thought that prices needed to be explained by some third factor, beyond supply and demand, because he believed that when supply and demand balance or equal each other, they can cancel each other out and thus could not explain equilibrium prices (hence the need for the labour theory of value to explain equilibrium prices). Steele argues this is mistaken as it is based on the view that supply and demand are magnitudes or numbers, when really they can be viewed more like schedules or functions. Supply and demand, when equal, do not cancel each other out but rather they are actually coinciding; at that particular price, the quantity supplied is equal to the quantity demanded. Price is thus always (proximately) determined by supply and demand, even when the two coincide. Thus when supply and demand are understood this way, Marx's argument cannot be forwarded. Eugene Böhm-Bawerk uses an analogy to a balloon filled with gas. The balloon will continue to rise through the air until the air pressure of the atmosphere and the air pressure within the balloon are in equilibrium. Thus the height of the balloon can only be explained by considering the relative density of the balloon on one side and the atmosphere on the other. However, Böhm-Bawerk argues that if Marx's view of equilibrium is used, then one would have to say that the densities would cancel each other out and thus have "ceased to act", meaning they cannot explain why the balloon is now floating, which is incorrect as it is the relative densities that explain why the balloon floats. Thus for Böhm-Bawerk, it is simply inaccurate to state that supply and demand cannot explain equilibrium prices because they supposedly cancel each other out. Meghnad Desai, Baron Desai observed that there is also the prospect of surplus value arising from sources other than labour and a classic given example is winemaking. When grapes are harvested and crushed, labour is used. However, when yeast is added and the grape juice is left to ferment in order to get wine, the value of wine exceeds that of the grapes significantly, yet labour contributes nothing to the extra value. Marx had ignored capital inputs due to placing them all together in constant capital—translating the wear and tear of capital in production in terms of its labour value. Yet examples such as this demonstrated that value and surplus value could come from somewhere other than labour. Some Marxists argue that this criticism is erroneous because the labour theory of value was only ever meant to refer to freely reproducible commodities (i.e those not limited by scaricity), which would exempt goods such as wine, paintings, land and so forth. However, a counter-criticism is that this position makes no sense because non-freely reproducible commodities are still commodities and if Marx wishes to find a common factor that underlies all commodities, this common factor must exist in all commodities, rather than a narrow conception of commodities. Marx has also been criticised for not making clear in his writings when he is using "commodity" in this narrow conception. Since Marx argued that skilled labor was simply "condensed" labor, he has been accused of circular reasoning, as he resolves the issue of the value of skilled labor in the labor theory of value by assuming the labor theory of value is true so that skilled labor is judged by its exchange-value. It has been argued that Marx's effort to distinguish between skilled and unskilled labor was incoherent, as all labor ultimately required some degree of skill - true unskilled labor would only be possible with mindless automatons as workers still need to think in order to produce. This means it is not possible to reduce skilled labor to unskilled labor (and thus determine the number of unskilled labor hours) because all labor is skilled, meaning that value cannot be determined just by counting labor hours. Furthermore, Marx asserted that skilled labor is allegedly more productive than unskilled labor, yet this explanation is both circular and incomplete. It is circular because productivity can only be compared by using wage and price differences, the very thing the labor theory of value is supposed to explain. It is incomplete because Marx does not explain why the additional value-creating power of skilled labor should necessarily be related to the labor cost of skill acquisition. While one suggested solution is that the skilled labor transfers its production time to the commodity it produces, this solution means that it is not the total number of hours of skill creation that matter but only those that the worker or their employer end up paying for, when in reality economics and politics are never separate, thus rendering the equilibrium assumptions behind the theory untenable. Much training is provided by the government, community and house for free. In addition, the economy is almost never at a fully competitive equilibrium, so there is no guarantee that the education and training will be transacted for at their value. Lastly, it is unclear what should be used as measure of unskilled labor (the unskilled labor of a school graduate, a peasant, a hunter-gatherer etc.) by which to measure skilled labor. The post-Keynesian economist Joan Robinson, who was otherwise sympathetic to Marx's writings, was strongly critical of the labor theory of value. She wrote that it was essentially a "metaphysical doctrine" and "logically a mere rigmarole of words". She writes: Value is something different from price, which accounts for prices, and which in turn has to be accounted for. And to account for it by labour-time is mere assertion... This theory of prices is not a myth... Nor was it intended to be an original contribution to science. It was simply an orthodox dogma. Others have pointed out that the labor theory of value is based on a failure to recognize the properly dialectical component of human desire. Pilkington writes: [V]alue is attributed to objects due to our desire for them. This desire, in turn, is inter-subjective. We desire to gain [a] medal or to capture [an] enemy flag [in battle] because it will win recognition in the eyes of our peers. [A] medal [or an enemy] flag are not valued for their objective properties, nor are they valued for the amount of labour embodied in them, rather they are desired for the symbolic positions they occupy in the inter-subjective network of desires. Pilkington says that this is a different theory of value than the one we find in many economics textbooks. He writes that in mainstream marginalist theory consumers are viewed in an atomistic manner, unaffected by the desires of their peers. He writes that "actors in marginalist analysis have self-contained preferences; they do not have inter-subjective desires". He says that dialectical analyses of value can be found in the work of Thorstein Veblen and James Duesenberry. In ecological economics, it is argued that labor is in fact energy over time. However, echoing Joan Robinson, Alf Hornborg argues that both the reliance on "energy theory of value" and "labor theory of value" are problematic as they propose that use-values (or material wealth) are more "real" than exchange-values (or cultural wealth)—yet, use-values are culturally determined. For Hornborg, any Marxist argument that claims uneven wealth is due to the "exploitation" or "underpayment" of use-values is actually a tautological contradiction, since it must necessarily quantify "underpayment" in terms of exchange-value. The alternative would be to conceptualize unequal exchange as "an asymmetric net transfer of material inputs in production (e.g., embodied labor, energy, land, and water), rather than in terms of an underpayment of material inputs or an asymmetric transfer of 'value'". In other words, uneven exchange is characterised by incommensurability, namely: the unequal transfer of material inputs; competing value-judgements of the worth of labor, fuel, and raw materials; differing availability of industrial technologies; and the off-loading of environmental burdens on those with less resources.

Elgpiggen is a mountain located within the municipalities of Tolga and Rendalen in Innlandet county and in the Holøydalen mountain area. The mountain is easily recognizable due to its shape as a pyramid. ""Elgpiggen"" means "the peak (piggen) of the mountain of the Elk", which is seen as the king of all animals inhabiting the Norwegian forest. Access to Elgpiggen is possible all year around. In the summer you can choose a six-kilometre walk from Orvdalen or a seven-kilometer walk from Heggerådalen. The easiest way of climbing the mountain is from the northwest side. Here you will find hikes along the mountain side which will guide you up the last, but very steep part all the way to the top. In the winter, cross-country skiing is the only possible way to reach the mountain. Here you may choose a longer route, 25 km, starting at Hodalen, a local, rural and cottage community. It is recommended though to go skiing here in the latter part of the winter season, due to problems with large amounts of snow in the area, making cross-country more difficult in unprepared terrain. Its steep pyramid shape makes Elgpiggen a perfect destination for off-piste skiing. From the top you can view other great peaks. In the west you will spot Snøhetta and Rondane while in the south you are able to see Rendalssølen with its three peaks.

Rufus Henry Ingram (1834–?) was a bushwhacker that led Captain Ingram's Partisan Rangers that operated in California in 1864. In 1863, Rufus Henry Ingram met George Baker from San Jose, California, who had just come east to join the Confederate Army. Baker complained because the secessionists in California had no experienced leaders. Ingram claimed to have been with Quantrill's Raiders during the Lawrence Massacre and became interested in going back with Baker to recruit soldiers for the Southern cause. In early 1864, Rufus Henry Ingram arrived in Santa Clara County with a Confederate commission as captain and with a former undersheriff of Monterey County, Tom Poole, organized about fifty local Knights of the Golden Circle and commanded them in what became known as Captain Ingram's Partisan Rangers. Finding difficulty in raising funds to purchase supplies for his unit, Ingram first planned a raid on San Jose to rob its banks and stores in the manner of Quantrill's raid on Lawrence. A quarrel within the band, however, led to the exposure of the plan to the local sheriff and it was abandoned. Soon after, Ingram decided to rob shipments of silver from the Comstock Lode to Sacramento. On June 30, Ingram, along with a small detachment, robbed two stagecoaches eleven miles east of Placerville of their gold and silver, leaving a letter explaining they were not bandits but carrying out a military operation to raise funds for the Confederacy. During the pursuit of his fleeing band, the posse had a gunfight with two lawmen at the Somerset House. One of the posse was killed, while Poole was wounded and left to be captured. After a two-day chase the Placerville posse lost their trail and they got to Santa Clara County a week later. Tom Poole gave a complete confession, the bullion was recovered and he exposed his companions identities. Regardless, they evaded the search for them in Santa Clara County. On July 15, an attempt by Ingram to rob the New Almaden Quicksilver Mine payroll failed, ending in a shootout with the posse of Santa Clara County Sheriff John Hicks Adams a mile and a half outside San Jose on the Almaden road. Two of Ingram's men were killed, while one of his men was wounded. The sheriff and his deputy were also wounded in the shootout. Ingram fled California for Missouri and was never captured afterwards.

Sam Thomas "Tommy" Burnett (August 1, 1942 – September 17, 2009) was a Tennessee politician who was Majority Leader of the Tennessee House of Representatives and who served two prison sentences for separate federal convictions. Burnett was born and raised in Goodlettsville, Tennessee. As a student at Goodlettsville High School he served as class president and was chosen "most likely to succeed." He attended Cumberland College and received a law degree from the University of Tennessee. While in law school he served as a lay minister for a Church of Christ congregation in Jamestown, Tennessee, where, following graduation, he established a law practice and began his political career. A Democrat, Burnett was first elected to the state legislature at age 28 in 1970, representing a district that included Fentress, Overton and Morgan counties on the Cumberland Plateau. After taking office in 1971, Burnett became a protégé of Ned McWherter, who was then house speaker. He soon assumed the role of floor leader for the Democrats during the governorship of Ray Blanton and later became house majority leader during the governorships of Lamar Alexander and Ned McWherter. As a politician, Burnett was known for his oratorical skill, persuasiveness, sense of humor, and effectiveness at working across party lines to achieve results. Some state political observers thought he could become governor. He is given much of the credit for winning passage of major education legislation proposed by Governor Alexander, nursing home reforms, the Tennessee Sentencing Commission Act, and tort reform. Among the successful legislation that he sponsored were laws mandating use of seatbelts and limiting the nighttime hours of work for teenage students. In 1983, Burnett was convicted in federal court for the misdemeanor of willfully failing to file federal income tax returns, and served 10 months in prison. While in a prison camp at Maxwell Air Force Base he was re-elected to the Tennessee House of Representatives, defeating two opponents in the primary and winning the November 1984 general election with 60 percent of the vote. He was convicted again in August 1990 on nine counts for his involvement in an illegal bingo gambling operation. In 1991, Burnett was convicted as a result of the Operation Rocky Top investigation by the FBI into corruption in the Tennessee General Assembly. One of his convictions was for defrauding a man he had met in prison and inducing him to invest $48,000 in the gambling operation. Burnett received a five-year prison sentence for his Operation Rocky Top conviction, and served 16 months before being released to a halfway house in August 1992. After his conviction, he was forced to end his campaign for re-election to an 11th term in the fall of 1990, and went to work as a car dealer during the appeals process. After six months in the halfway house, he began a new career as a talk radio commentator on "Teddy Bart's Roundtable" program in Nashville. As a convicted felon, Burnett lost his law license and could not seek public office again. However, he succeeded in getting the law license restored in 2003 and became a lobbyist in the General Assembly in his final years, although health problems, including severe diabetes, limited his physical activity. Burnett's career also included stints as a cattle rancher, oil prospector, chicken farmer, and seller of fireworks. He is credited with helping to establish the Highway 127 Corridor Sale, which has been called "the world's largest flea market." Burnett died September 17, 2009, in a hospital in Nashville. His funeral was September 20, 2009, in the Fentress County community of Banner Springs. His remains were transported in a mule-drawn carriage to Springs Chapel Cemetery for burial.

Krastyo Hadzhipetrov Asenov, nicknamed Mechkata (the Bear), Ogneniot daskal (the Fiery Teacher) and Cherkeza (the Circassian), was a Bulgarian revolutionary figure active in the region of Macedonia, one of the voyvodas of the Internal Macedonian-Adrianople Revolutionary Organization (IMARO) for the Enidzhe Vardar region. He took part in the liberation struggles of the Macedonians at the beginning of the 20th century. Krastyo Asenov was born in 1877 in Sliven. He was a nephew of the famous Macedonian Bulgarian voyvoda Hadzhi Dimitar and a brother of the IMARO revolutionary Yordan Asenov. He graduated from the Bulgarian Men's High School of Varna and later from the Sofia University. Afterwards Asenov worked as a Bulgarian Exarchate teacher in Macedonia. Under the influence of Gotse Delchev, he joined the IMARO and the struggle for the liberation of Macedonia and Odrin from the Turkish yoke. When he was a teacher in the village of Leshko, Asenov met Yane Sandanski. He was one of the organizers and took an active role in the Miss Stone Affair. In 1902, his sister, Doctor Sabka Asenova, preserved a part of the ransom collected from the Miss Stone Affair. Asenov's cousins, Dimitar Asenov and Ivan Asenov were freedom fighters in the revolutionary band of the voyvoda Toma Davidov. During 1902, Asenov's revolutionary activity was concentrated on the right coast of the Struma River. During the Ilinden-Preobrazhenie Uprising he was a voyvoda of the Kilkis cheta and fought against the Ottomans in the area of the Paiak Mountain. In the village of Kornishor, there was a merger between the Kilkis band of Krastyo Asenov, and the Enizhe-Vardar bands of Apostol Petkov and Ivan Karasuliyata. Here the flag of the uprising was sanctified before 250 Macedonian freedom fighters. On June 6, he fought a battle against Turkish soldiers near the Ardzhan Lake, in which Milan Delchev was killed. On June 16, Asenov fought a battle near the village of Postol. Despite the rumour amongst his fellows, that it would be a bad sign, on July 25, when the Uprising was still ongoing, he married Ana Maleshevska, the daughter of the voyvoda Nikola Maleshevski, in the village of Kornishor (today known as Kromni), in the Enidzhe-Vardar region. However, he was killed only several days after the wedding by his superstitious comrades, dissatisfied with his decision to marry. Later, they were sentenced to death by the IMARO revolutionary-court.

List of the cardinals attested in the contemporary sources during the period of pornocracy (904 – 964) and later until the election of Pope John XV in August 985. It certainly contains only small part of all cardinals living at that time because only small number of documents and other accounts useful for the reconstruction of that list have been preserved to our times. The dates in the parentheses mark the first and last time when the cardinal appears in the sources. Note: diocese of Sabina became a suburbicarian see only in 1063. Although some of its bishops in the 10th century are known by name, they should not be included in the list of cardinals. Numerous writers from the 16th century onwards, including Alphonsus Ciacconius (1540–1599), Lorenzo Cardella etc. have mentioned several other cardinals ostensibly created during this period, which, however, for various reasons should be either eliminated from that list or classified as dubious ("presumed cardinals"). They can be divided in four subsequent categories. Note: in some cases it is possible that the promotion really took place; however, there is no evidence to ascertain it: The following cardinals allegedly promoted in 10th century up to date have not been identified in the published documents from the Roman registers: Two cardinals, ostensibly elected to the papacy, are fictitious persons which owe their existence an onomastic confusion They both are not listed in the official series of Popes in Annuario Pontificio. Some documents which bear the subscriptions of the cardinals have been recognized as falsehoods and although some authors unaware of this fact used them as sources for the reconstruction of the catalogue of cardinals in the 10th century, they are useless for this purpose:

Vasyl' Shakhrai (; February 11, 1888 – 1919) was a Ukrainian political activist and Bolshevik revolutionary during the Russian Revolution. He was а founder of what came to be called National Communism. Shakhrai joined the Bolsheviks after completing his training at the Military Academy in Poltava in 1917, while some sources claim that he was already Bolshevik since 1913. He was one of the few Ukrainians amongst the Poltava Bolsheviks. At the time the Bolsheviks were in a unified organisation with the local Mensheviks, but Shakhrai supported Serhii Mazlakh, a Jewish Poltava Bolshevik who successfully ousted the Mensheviks by August 1917. Shakhrai and Mazlakh were then elected editors of the weekly newspaper. By this time Shakhrai was supporting Ukrainian national interests within the party. Although this caused concern amongst the predominantly Jewish local Mensheviks, he gained support amongst local Bolsheviks, who felt that it helped gain support amongst the largely anti-Russian Ukrainians of the region. Shakhrai was elected as a delegate to both the First All-Ukrainian Consultative Conference of the CP(b)U and the First All Ukrainian Congress of Soviets. He was also appointed the People's Commissar for Military Affairs in the Soviet Ukrainian government. In this capacity he accompanied Trotsky to Brest Litovsk for the treaty negotiations there in March 1918. He was concerned about the suppression of Ukrainian cultural organizations by Russian Bolshevik troops who were sent to Ukraine in January and February 1918. Lenin consented to the dismemberment of Ukraine through the founding of the Donets-Krivoy Rog Soviet Republic as a ruse to place it outside the terms of the Brest Litovsk Treaty. Although this stratagem failed, it further raised concerns for Shakrai as regards to how the Bolsheviks were treating Ukraine. This concern was increased when Lenin gave a speech in November 1918, which called upon party functionaries to consider themselves Russian patriots. By December 1918 his alienation from the Bolsheviks was more or less complete. His pamphlet "The Revolution in Ukraine" was published in November 1918, followed by "On the Current Situation in Ukraine" in January 1919. It led to Shakhrai expulsion from the CP(b)U in June 1919. Shakhrai then went to Saratov, then occupied by Anton Denikin's White Volunteer Army. Here he worked on a number of underground newspapers, before being arrested and shot by Denikin's administration in autumn 1919.
